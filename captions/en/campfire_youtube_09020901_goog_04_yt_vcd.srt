00:00:00,434 --> 00:00:04,934
[applause]

2
00:00:04,934 --> 00:00:06,801
Kevin Gibbs: Great.
Thanks a lot, Mike.

3
00:00:06,801 --> 00:00:09,300
Well, I want to talk about
one more thing about SDC

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,434
before I move on,
and that's integration.

5
00:00:11,434 --> 00:00:14,200
Now, if any of you have worked
with web services before,

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,601
you know that there are
a lot of different types

7
00:00:16,601 --> 00:00:18,133
and a lot of different formats,

8
00:00:18,133 --> 00:00:19,968
and integrating
is not always easy.

9
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:22,534
To help with that,
something that we've done

10
00:00:22,534 --> 00:00:24,801
is we've worked with a number
of Enterprise partners

11
00:00:24,801 --> 00:00:26,267
to create connectors for SDC,

12
00:00:26,267 --> 00:00:27,367
that make it easy to work

13
00:00:27,367 --> 00:00:28,968
with the Enterprise
software packages

14
00:00:28,968 --> 00:00:30,467
that you already have.

15
00:00:30,467 --> 00:00:32,701
There are already
50 connectors available,

16
00:00:32,701 --> 00:00:34,968
and if there's an
Enterprise software package

17
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:36,734
you're using that doesn't
have a connector,

18
00:00:36,734 --> 00:00:38,334
we have
another set of partners

19
00:00:38,334 --> 00:00:39,367
who are eager to help out,

20
00:00:39,367 --> 00:00:40,901
can help you create a solution.

21
00:00:40,901 --> 00:00:44,267
Now, let's recap about
what I've already talked about

22
00:00:44,267 --> 00:00:45,734
this evening really briefly.

23
00:00:45,734 --> 00:00:47,968
I've talked about some
major features for App Engine.

24
00:00:47,968 --> 00:00:51,267
One, we have the ability to
purchase additional resources.

25
00:00:51,267 --> 00:00:54,000
We talked about
the cron support for App Engine.

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,534
We talked about the ability

27
00:00:55,534 --> 00:00:57,734
to import
large amounts of data

28
00:00:57,734 --> 00:01:00,267
and the ability to access data
behind the firewall.

29
00:01:00,267 --> 00:01:03,267
Now, we think
all of these things together

30
00:01:03,267 --> 00:01:05,767
make App Engine
a more viable platform

31
00:01:05,767 --> 00:01:06,934
for more developers

32
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:09,334
and more people
who are building applications,

33
00:01:09,334 --> 00:01:11,400
but we still have
a promise to keep to you.

34
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,133
When I was here last year,
one year to this day,

35
00:01:14,133 --> 00:01:15,267
I promised that Python

36
00:01:15,267 --> 00:01:17,434
was just the first language
for App Engine,

37
00:01:17,434 --> 00:01:20,033
the first runtime language
that we would support.

38
00:01:20,033 --> 00:01:22,767
Thus tonight,
I'm really excited to announce

39
00:01:22,767 --> 00:01:25,133
our early look
at Java language support

40
00:01:25,133 --> 00:01:27,567
for App Engine.

41
00:01:27,567 --> 00:01:28,801
[applause]

42
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:33,033
Now--

43
00:01:33,033 --> 00:01:34,801
Now, what's up
with the early look?

44
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:36,567
You guys might be wondering.

45
00:01:36,567 --> 00:01:38,100
Now, the reason
for the early look

46
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,467
is that we feel that the support
we're launching right now

47
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:41,901
is not yet complete.

48
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:44,367
We've got a lot of details
that we need to work out,

49
00:01:44,367 --> 00:01:47,234
and things that we need to make
run a little more smoothly.

50
00:01:47,234 --> 00:01:49,601
Particularly, due to the nature
of the environment,

51
00:01:49,601 --> 00:01:51,400
we know a lot of software
that you're used to

52
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,300
and a lot of frameworks
you've used before

53
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,934
may need some slight adjustments

54
00:01:54,934 --> 00:01:56,534
to work properly
on App Engine.

55
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:59,734
Thus, we want to learn
what those things are

56
00:01:59,734 --> 00:02:01,734
and get your help to fix them,

57
00:02:01,734 --> 00:02:03,901
so that we can make App Engine
work better for you

58
00:02:03,901 --> 00:02:05,033
and for everyone else,

59
00:02:05,033 --> 00:02:06,601
so that's why we're giving you

60
00:02:06,601 --> 00:02:08,300
this early access
to the product,

61
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,367
to get that feedback,

62
00:02:09,367 --> 00:02:12,067
and get the product on track.

63
00:02:12,067 --> 00:02:13,868
Now, with all of that said,

64
00:02:13,868 --> 00:02:15,667
I think what we're launching
to you tonight

65
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:16,801
is pretty impressive.

66
00:02:16,801 --> 00:02:17,934
For the first time,

67
00:02:17,934 --> 00:02:20,534
we've given you
an in-to-in solution,

68
00:02:20,534 --> 00:02:23,501
a runtime, a Java runtime
for App Engine,

69
00:02:23,501 --> 00:02:26,334
an Eclipse plugin
for the Eclipse IDE,

70
00:02:26,334 --> 00:02:29,100
and integrated
Google Web Toolkit support

71
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,100
for your UI.

72
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,267
Altogether,
this allows you--

73
00:02:32,267 --> 00:02:33,267
[applause]

74
00:02:33,267 --> 00:02:34,701
Thanks.

75
00:02:34,701 --> 00:02:36,167
Altogether,
this allows you

76
00:02:36,167 --> 00:02:38,834
to build a client
and the server together,

77
00:02:38,834 --> 00:02:41,067
in one integrated
development experience,

78
00:02:41,067 --> 00:02:42,734
using a single language,

79
00:02:42,734 --> 00:02:45,334
and a single, seamless
application that you create.

80
00:02:45,334 --> 00:02:46,734
We think that's pretty cool.

81
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:48,601
So tonight,
for the rest of the night,

82
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:49,901
I'm going to take you through

83
00:02:49,901 --> 00:02:52,267
our early look at Java support
for App Engine.

84
00:02:52,267 --> 00:02:54,734
I'm going to take you through,
initially,

85
00:02:54,734 --> 00:02:57,367
a demonstration that we built
using GuestBook,

86
00:02:57,367 --> 00:02:59,701
an application
that just allows you

87
00:02:59,701 --> 00:03:01,100
to quickly enter some stuff.

88
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,868
Andrew is going to take you
through that demo

89
00:03:03,868 --> 00:03:05,567
and how we built
the GuestBook app.

90
00:03:05,567 --> 00:03:07,701
Then I'm also going to
bring on some partners

91
00:03:07,701 --> 00:03:09,467
who've built
some real-world apps

92
00:03:09,467 --> 00:03:11,400
using App Engine,
Google Web Toolkit,

93
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,434
and other things,

94
00:03:12,434 --> 00:03:14,200
so that you can see how
this can be--

95
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,567
you could use this yourself

96
00:03:15,567 --> 00:03:17,267
to accomplish
some other things.

97
00:03:17,267 --> 00:03:18,734
But to get started,

98
00:03:18,734 --> 00:03:21,067
let me take you through
the Java runtime support

99
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,267
for App Engine.

100
00:03:22,267 --> 00:03:24,968
Now, our Java runtime support
for App Engine

101
00:03:24,968 --> 00:03:26,667
allows you to utilize
all the APIs

102
00:03:26,667 --> 00:03:28,868
that you already have available
on App Engine.

103
00:03:28,868 --> 00:03:31,901
That includes things like
our scalable data store,

104
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:34,300
which is based on BigTable,
not SQL,

105
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,133
things like memcache,
our serving architecture,

106
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:39,334
and also all of the existing
management tools

107
00:03:39,334 --> 00:03:40,334
you've been using,

108
00:03:40,334 --> 00:03:42,367
such as our
administration console,

109
00:03:42,367 --> 00:03:44,534
the billing support
I mentioned earlier,

110
00:03:44,534 --> 00:03:45,701
and all of that.

111
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:46,834
It makes it easy for you

112
00:03:46,834 --> 00:03:49,000
to build and deploy
web applications.

113
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,167
But there's something

114
00:03:50,167 --> 00:03:52,133
that I think
is particularly interesting

115
00:03:52,133 --> 00:03:53,334
about our Java support.

116
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:55,501
We built our Java support
around Servlets

117
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:57,968
and the web.xml standard.

118
00:03:57,968 --> 00:04:00,701
These are the standard ways
of building web apps in Java,

119
00:04:00,701 --> 00:04:02,234
so what that means for you,

120
00:04:02,234 --> 00:04:04,601
is if you've ever built
a web app in Java before,

121
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:05,901
you probably already know

122
00:04:05,901 --> 00:04:08,067
how to build a web app
for Google App Engine.

123
00:04:08,067 --> 00:04:09,834
It's the same thing
you're used to,

124
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:11,601
written in the same way.

125
00:04:11,601 --> 00:04:13,667
Now, the other major detail

126
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:16,167
about our Java runtime
support for App Engine,

127
00:04:16,167 --> 00:04:20,167
is that it is a full
Java 1.6 JVM.

128
00:04:20,167 --> 00:04:21,400
Now, what does that mean?

129
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,033
That means two important things.

130
00:04:23,033 --> 00:04:24,200
One, it means that

131
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,801
we're running byte code
on the server,

132
00:04:25,801 --> 00:04:27,467
not your source code.

133
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:30,667
You only send us
your compiled application.

134
00:04:30,667 --> 00:04:33,267
Two, it means that because
we're running byte code,

135
00:04:33,267 --> 00:04:35,501
App Engine's
Java runtime support

136
00:04:35,501 --> 00:04:38,667
can run other languages
that compile to Java byte code,

137
00:04:38,667 --> 00:04:42,067
things like JavaScript,
Ruby, Groovy,

138
00:04:42,067 --> 00:04:43,701
and other projects.

139
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:45,100
Now, I should make it clear--

140
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,100
just because we can
run those languages

141
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,467
in the Java runtime support,

142
00:04:48,467 --> 00:04:50,234
doesn't mean
that your applications

143
00:04:50,234 --> 00:04:52,968
written in those languages
will just work automatically.

144
00:04:52,968 --> 00:04:54,267
There's still a lot of work

145
00:04:54,267 --> 00:04:55,601
to be done with integration,

146
00:04:55,601 --> 00:04:57,601
to make sure everything
runs smoothly,

147
00:04:57,601 --> 00:04:59,968
particularly with
our serving infrastructure

148
00:04:59,968 --> 00:05:02,334
and our security infrastructure
on App Engine,

149
00:05:02,334 --> 00:05:05,868
many frameworks will need to be
adjusted slightly.

150
00:05:05,868 --> 00:05:07,033
We also have a white list

151
00:05:07,033 --> 00:05:08,801
of JRE classes
that are available,

152
00:05:08,801 --> 00:05:10,801
which may sometimes result
in changes.

153
00:05:10,801 --> 00:05:12,934
However, that's why
we're launching this

154
00:05:12,934 --> 00:05:13,968
early to you now,

155
00:05:13,968 --> 00:05:15,200
so we can get your help

156
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,501
in making sure everything

157
00:05:16,501 --> 00:05:18,968
does work smoothly
on App Engine.

158
00:05:18,968 --> 00:05:22,367
Now, our overall goal
with our entry in Java support

159
00:05:22,367 --> 00:05:23,934
is to give you tools

160
00:05:23,934 --> 00:05:26,000
that compliment
your existing workflow,

161
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,868
how you already
build applications.

162
00:05:27,868 --> 00:05:30,567
And one thing we know
about a lot of Java developers

163
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:33,801
is that you use IDEs
to get these applications built.

164
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:35,701
So as I mentioned earlier,

165
00:05:35,701 --> 00:05:37,234
that's why I'm excited tonight

166
00:05:37,234 --> 00:05:40,000
to announce
the Google plugin for Eclipse.

167
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,634
The Google plugin for Eclipse

168
00:05:41,634 --> 00:05:44,467
integrates every step
of the application development,

169
00:05:44,467 --> 00:05:46,634
from creating
and managing a project

170
00:05:46,634 --> 00:05:48,567
to doing local testing
and debugging,

171
00:05:48,567 --> 00:05:51,367
and to finally
deploying to App Engine.

172
00:05:51,367 --> 00:05:54,067
It even integrates
using Google Web Toolkit

173
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:55,467
to create your front-end UI,

174
00:05:55,467 --> 00:05:57,334
which I'll talk about
a little bit later.

175
00:05:57,334 --> 00:06:00,234
Now, we think this is great
for productivity.

176
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,434
You're programming
just in one language,

177
00:06:02,434 --> 00:06:03,868
in one familiar IDE

178
00:06:03,868 --> 00:06:05,501
that you're
already comfortable with.

179
00:06:05,501 --> 00:06:08,767
And because App Engine
is always free to get started,

180
00:06:08,767 --> 00:06:11,267
it means that anyone
can download this SDK

181
00:06:11,267 --> 00:06:14,234
and start building
an application right away.

182
00:06:14,234 --> 00:06:16,601
Now, I want you to know
one other thing, though.

183
00:06:16,601 --> 00:06:19,434
Although we are launching
the Google plugin for Eclipse,

184
00:06:19,434 --> 00:06:22,133
we're in no way tied
to this Eclipse support.

185
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:24,934
We're also providing you
with robust, stand-alone tools

186
00:06:24,934 --> 00:06:27,367
that you can use
to build applications,

187
00:06:27,367 --> 00:06:29,300
and that means that you can work
with other IDEs

188
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,367
like IntelliJ or Visual Studio,

189
00:06:31,367 --> 00:06:34,467
or you can work with tools
on the command line.

190
00:06:34,467 --> 00:06:38,868
Now, one more aspect about
our Java support for App Engine

191
00:06:38,868 --> 00:06:40,734
that I'm particularly
excited about

192
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,100
is our support for standards.

193
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,567
Our Java support
for App Engine

194
00:06:45,567 --> 00:06:48,567
is 100% standard spaced.

195
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:50,334
Now, what does that mean?

196
00:06:50,334 --> 00:06:52,300
That means two key things.

197
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,601
One, it means
that if you choose,

198
00:06:54,601 --> 00:06:56,000
you can build an application

199
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,834
on our early look at Java
support for App Engine

200
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:02,167
that does not use
a single proprietary API.

201
00:07:02,167 --> 00:07:04,767
Through these standards
for everything that we do,

202
00:07:04,767 --> 00:07:07,400
including specifying
your web application

203
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,734
for accessing HTTP resources,

204
00:07:09,734 --> 00:07:11,801
and even for working
with our datastore,

205
00:07:11,801 --> 00:07:13,167
which is based on BigTable,

206
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:15,968
there is a standard
that you can use

207
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:19,801
backed by a JSR and sign
for building your application.

208
00:07:19,801 --> 00:07:21,434
For our datastore in particular,

209
00:07:21,434 --> 00:07:23,934
we're supporting
the Java persistence API

210
00:07:23,934 --> 00:07:26,067
and the Java data
object standards.

211
00:07:26,067 --> 00:07:28,100
And that means that if
you build an application

212
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,834
with these standard APIs,

213
00:07:29,834 --> 00:07:32,367
your same application
can work with BigTable

214
00:07:32,367 --> 00:07:34,834
and a SQL server easily.

215
00:07:34,834 --> 00:07:37,901
Now, the second detail
about our standard support

216
00:07:37,901 --> 00:07:40,634
is that if you choose to build
your application

217
00:07:40,634 --> 00:07:41,934
to all of these standards,

218
00:07:41,934 --> 00:07:43,067
it makes it easy for you

219
00:07:43,067 --> 00:07:45,334
to run your application
elsewhere,

220
00:07:45,334 --> 00:07:46,901
because these same standard APIs

221
00:07:46,901 --> 00:07:49,400
work in any other
Servlet container.

222
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,567
That means that you can build
an application on App Engine,

223
00:07:52,567 --> 00:07:54,200
and without changing
the line of code

224
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,033
or making any significant
modifications,

225
00:07:56,033 --> 00:07:58,601
you can run that application
on premise...

226
00:07:58,601 --> 00:08:00,934
behind your firewall.

227
00:08:00,934 --> 00:08:04,200
You're not locked in
to using our cloud.

228
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,234
So, with that,
if you're like me,

229
00:08:06,234 --> 00:08:07,501
you're probably itching

230
00:08:07,501 --> 00:08:09,033
to actually see
a demo of this,

231
00:08:09,033 --> 00:08:10,200
and see how it all works.

232
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,300
So for that,

233
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,834
I'd like to call up
Andrew Bowers,

234
00:08:12,834 --> 00:08:14,067
the product manager at Google,

235
00:08:14,067 --> 00:08:15,467
and he's
going to step you through

236
00:08:15,467 --> 00:08:16,868
creating a GuestBook application

237
00:08:16,868 --> 00:08:20,601
using our Eclipse integration
and App Engine.

238
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:22,000
Thank you, Andrew.
