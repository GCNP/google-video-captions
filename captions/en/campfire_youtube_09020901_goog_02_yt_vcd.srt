1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:03,467
Now, another request we've heard
from a lot of you guys

2
00:00:03,467 --> 00:00:05,868
is that right now it's
a little bit challenging

3
00:00:05,868 --> 00:00:08,634
to move data
in and out of App Engine.

4
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:09,734
If you've got a lot of data,

5
00:00:09,734 --> 00:00:12,367
such as something
in an existing database

6
00:00:12,367 --> 00:00:13,801
that you have on site,

7
00:00:13,801 --> 00:00:16,234
it can be hard to get that
into App Engine's datastore

8
00:00:16,234 --> 00:00:19,033
to start playing with
and testing apps.

9
00:00:19,033 --> 00:00:22,234
So in response to that, tonight
we're excited to announce

10
00:00:22,234 --> 00:00:25,400
our large-scale
data import tool.

11
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,334
This tool makes it really easy
to move gigabytes of data

12
00:00:28,334 --> 00:00:29,968
into the datastore
in App Engine.

13
00:00:29,968 --> 00:00:33,767
You can start, stop,
or resume your upload,

14
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:35,734
and it handles errors
that you might encounter

15
00:00:35,734 --> 00:00:37,200
as you're sending a lot of data,

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,968
possibly over the course
of a few days.

17
00:00:38,968 --> 00:00:43,000
Now, we're also
working on an export tool.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,968
So it'll be just as
easy for you to move

19
00:00:44,968 --> 00:00:47,033
the gigabytes of data
you have in App Engine

20
00:00:47,033 --> 00:00:50,100
off and have
a local backup copy.

21
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,234
After all, it's your data.

22
00:00:52,234 --> 00:00:54,234
You should be able to do
anything you want with it,

23
00:00:54,234 --> 00:00:58,267
to move it on or off
as easily as we can make it.

24
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:00,467
Now, the next feature
I'd like to talk about briefly

25
00:01:00,467 --> 00:01:04,434
is particularly exciting
to our enterprise developers.

26
00:01:04,434 --> 00:01:06,634
One thing we've heard from
a lot of enterprise developers

27
00:01:06,634 --> 00:01:08,400
is they'd like a way
to connect to the data

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,601
that they have
behind the firewall.

29
00:01:10,601 --> 00:01:13,234
The stuff they haven't
put in the cloud yet.

30
00:01:13,234 --> 00:01:15,334
In fact we've heard from
a lot of enterprise developers

31
00:01:15,334 --> 00:01:18,000
that they feel like
they're being forced to choose--

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,267
to choose between
having applications

33
00:01:20,267 --> 00:01:22,767
that are easy to access
in the cloud,

34
00:01:22,767 --> 00:01:24,267
or applications that have

35
00:01:24,267 --> 00:01:26,801
the security of data
behind the firewall.

36
00:01:26,801 --> 00:01:28,767
Well, we don't think
you should have to choose.

37
00:01:28,767 --> 00:01:30,701
So tonight,
I'm excited to announce

38
00:01:30,701 --> 00:01:34,200
the Secure Data Connector,
or SDC.

39
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,634
SDC makes it easy to have
policy-controlled access

40
00:01:37,634 --> 00:01:40,501
in your applications
to your on-premise data

41
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:42,567
that's behind the firewall.

42
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:44,701
Now, before I get
into a more complicated, uh,

43
00:01:44,701 --> 00:01:46,334
description of how SDC works,

44
00:01:46,334 --> 00:01:50,234
I wanna show you
an example of SDC in action.

45
00:01:50,234 --> 00:01:52,367
Now, uh, I'm also
a manager here at Google,

46
00:01:52,367 --> 00:01:55,501
so I sometimes
have to manage my reports,

47
00:01:55,501 --> 00:01:58,467
and I might need to see
a report of my employees.

48
00:01:58,467 --> 00:02:00,300
So here we have
a sample spreadsheet

49
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,501
where we've imported
some employee data

50
00:02:02,501 --> 00:02:05,033
that lives behind the firewall.

51
00:02:05,033 --> 00:02:08,267
Now, this data here is not--
has been changed,

52
00:02:08,267 --> 00:02:09,634
so this is not
real employees' data,

53
00:02:09,634 --> 00:02:10,634
to protect peoples' privacy.

54
00:02:10,634 --> 00:02:11,634
[laughter]

55
00:02:11,634 --> 00:02:12,868
So you can
get off the phones now.

56
00:02:12,868 --> 00:02:15,400
Um, but it is actually
coming behind our--

57
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,868
from behind our firewall.

58
00:02:16,868 --> 00:02:18,033
You can see from the url

59
00:02:18,033 --> 00:02:20,667
this is actually
coming from within Google.

60
00:02:20,667 --> 00:02:23,133
Now, we've set up a policy
on this spreadsheet

61
00:02:23,133 --> 00:02:27,334
that says that I, Kevin Gibbs,
can access this spreadsheet

62
00:02:27,334 --> 00:02:29,934
and through this spreadsheet
can access that url.

63
00:02:29,934 --> 00:02:32,167
The policy is very specific.

64
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:34,434
And due to that policy,
and the fact that I'm logged in,

65
00:02:34,434 --> 00:02:35,868
which you can see
in the right-hand--

66
00:02:35,868 --> 00:02:37,267
the upper right-hand side,

67
00:02:37,267 --> 00:02:39,767
I can actually do a query
in this spreadsheet

68
00:02:39,767 --> 00:02:41,067
and the spreadsheet will be--

69
00:02:41,067 --> 00:02:43,200
and the query will be
sent through Google

70
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,534
down to inside the firewall.

71
00:02:44,534 --> 00:02:47,334
So lemme try a query, here.

72
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,868
And you can see it'll
actually send out that url

73
00:02:49,868 --> 00:02:52,934
and return some new data.

74
00:02:52,934 --> 00:02:55,434
Now, that's really--
once the page loads--

75
00:02:55,434 --> 00:02:57,167
that's really
all there is to it.

76
00:02:57,167 --> 00:03:00,334
As you can see, the import data
commands got a url in there,

77
00:03:00,334 --> 00:03:02,534
that u--and the
Secure Data Connector tells it

78
00:03:02,534 --> 00:03:06,033
how to find the right url
and return that data.

79
00:03:06,033 --> 00:03:08,334
That's it.
That's all you have to do.

80
00:03:08,334 --> 00:03:11,133
And really that's
part of the beauty of SDC.

81
00:03:11,133 --> 00:03:12,968
It's really easy
for you to set this up

82
00:03:12,968 --> 00:03:15,400
and gain access
to your firewall data.

83
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,167
You don't have to
set up a proxy,

84
00:03:17,167 --> 00:03:18,901
you don't have to
change your VPN,

85
00:03:18,901 --> 00:03:20,400
or do anything like that.

86
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,400
In fact, sort of
the magic of SDC

87
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,634
is that you can use this app
in the airport

88
00:03:24,634 --> 00:03:28,367
and gain access
to that firewall data.

89
00:03:28,367 --> 00:03:30,534
Now, I'd like to now tell you
a little bit more

90
00:03:30,534 --> 00:03:32,501
about how SDC actually works.

91
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:33,834
'Cause it's pretty important

92
00:03:33,834 --> 00:03:36,200
given the security involved
in what it's doing.

93
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,601
SDC is built around
having an agent

94
00:03:38,601 --> 00:03:40,601
that runs inside the firewall,

95
00:03:40,601 --> 00:03:43,634
and a set of servers
that run at Google.

96
00:03:43,634 --> 00:03:46,200
The SDC agent then connects--

97
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,534
You run the SDC agent,
and it makes a connection

98
00:03:48,534 --> 00:03:50,400
to our servers in the cloud.

99
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,100
And that gives the servers
at Google access--

100
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,567
policy-controlled access
to the data

101
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,033
that you've chosen to expose.

102
00:03:56,033 --> 00:03:59,901
That means that
Google App Engine applications,

103
00:03:59,901 --> 00:04:03,133
gadgets, and spreadsheets
can all have access

104
00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:06,534
to the data that you specify
in your policy.

105
00:04:06,534 --> 00:04:09,334
We wanted SDC to be
straightforward to use

106
00:04:09,334 --> 00:04:11,734
while still giving you
the security that you needed

107
00:04:11,734 --> 00:04:13,901
to run your application.

108
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:15,467
And so that lead
to a few design goals

109
00:04:15,467 --> 00:04:17,601
that we have for SDC.

110
00:04:17,601 --> 00:04:19,868
One, we wanted SDC to be simple.

111
00:04:19,868 --> 00:04:21,734
Want it to be simple
for you to use.

112
00:04:21,734 --> 00:04:23,834
And that--for that simplicity
is embodied with two things.

113
00:04:23,834 --> 00:04:27,200
One, we wanted to make it
easy for you to run the agent.

114
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,434
All you need to do
is take our agent software

115
00:04:29,434 --> 00:04:32,801
and install it on any Linux
machine within the firewall.

116
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:34,367
Once you do,
it'll connect and authenticate

117
00:04:34,367 --> 00:04:36,300
with Google Apps
and make the data available

118
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,634
to anything else at Google

119
00:04:37,634 --> 00:04:39,901
that you've granted
that permission to the data.

120
00:04:39,901 --> 00:04:43,300
Within applications,
whether it's a spreadsheet

121
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,467
or an App Engine app,
or what have you,

122
00:04:45,467 --> 00:04:47,868
it's very easy
to use SDC as well.

123
00:04:47,868 --> 00:04:50,300
All you need to state
is the url that you wanna reach

124
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,300
and Google will
automatically route it

125
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,868
down through the agent
within your firewall.

126
00:04:55,868 --> 00:04:58,501
Now, the next goal
with SDC was security.

127
00:04:58,501 --> 00:05:02,000
Obviously, for a tool like this,
making it as secure as possible

128
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,400
is one of the most
important considerations.

129
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,601
That's why all the data
that you send with SDC

130
00:05:06,601 --> 00:05:09,000
is encrypted with SSL.

131
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,567
But it also means that we wanted
to make it secure

132
00:05:11,567 --> 00:05:13,167
for your organization.

133
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:14,534
That's why when you use SDC,

134
00:05:14,534 --> 00:05:16,734
you don't have to open
a new port in your firewall

135
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:19,334
or change anything about
the settings of your network.

136
00:05:19,334 --> 00:05:22,567
It only makes outbound
connections to Google.

137
00:05:22,567 --> 00:05:25,033
And finally, we wanted
the policies that you use in SDC

138
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,667
to be very specific.

139
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:27,834
That's why the policies

140
00:05:27,834 --> 00:05:31,334
are at the application,
user, and url level.

141
00:05:31,334 --> 00:05:33,133
That means you have
very fine-grain support

142
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:36,200
over exactly who, uh,
can access any of the data

143
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,701
that you've exposed.

144
00:05:38,701 --> 00:05:40,367
Now, the final consideration
we have for SDC

145
00:05:40,367 --> 00:05:42,133
is we want it to be open.

146
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:45,467
So to achieve that,
we've actually open-sourced

147
00:05:45,467 --> 00:05:47,901
the entire SDC agent.

148
00:05:47,901 --> 00:05:49,234
You can go
and check out the code now

149
00:05:49,234 --> 00:05:51,801
and audit it yourself
if you'd like.

150
00:05:51,801 --> 00:05:54,167
We've also chosen to use
the OAF protocol

151
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:56,467
when authenticating
from the server to--

152
00:05:56,467 --> 00:05:59,801
at Google down
to your agent software.

153
00:05:59,801 --> 00:06:01,601
The OAF protocol
is an open standard

154
00:06:01,601 --> 00:06:04,033
that has seen a lot
of public scrutiny.

155
00:06:04,033 --> 00:06:05,367
And we think that it represents

156
00:06:05,367 --> 00:06:08,501
the best practices
in authentication.

157
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:12,434
Now, I've shown you
a really simple example of SDC.

158
00:06:12,434 --> 00:06:14,834
I'd like to now
call up Mark from Oracle,

159
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:17,067
who's gonna show you
a real-world example

160
00:06:17,067 --> 00:06:20,400
of using SDC to connect
to seeable data.

161
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,868
Mark.

162
00:06:21,868 --> 00:06:23,234
[applause]
