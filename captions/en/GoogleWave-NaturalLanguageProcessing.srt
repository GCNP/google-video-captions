00:00:05,734 --> 00:00:08,234
Whitelaw: Hi. My name
is Casey Whitelaw.

2
00:00:08,234 --> 00:00:09,234
I'm the Tech Lead

3
00:00:09,234 --> 00:00:10,567
for the Natural Language
Processing Group

4
00:00:10,567 --> 00:00:12,501
here in Sydney,
and today I'm gonna talk to you

5
00:00:12,501 --> 00:00:13,901
a little bit about

6
00:00:13,901 --> 00:00:16,601
some of the cool things
that we've added to Google Wave.

7
00:00:16,601 --> 00:00:18,834
So one of the main things

8
00:00:18,834 --> 00:00:21,834
that we want to stay focused on
in Google Wave is productivity.

9
00:00:21,834 --> 00:00:23,634
We want users to be able
to stay productive,

10
00:00:23,634 --> 00:00:25,734
whether they're reading
or whether they're writing.

11
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,601
One of the ways
that we've done that

12
00:00:27,601 --> 00:00:29,267
is with our
spell correction system.

13
00:00:29,267 --> 00:00:32,234
What we'd like is for users
just to be able to

14
00:00:32,234 --> 00:00:34,534
focus on what they're typing
and not worry about

15
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,801
whether there's any mistakes
they've made.

16
00:00:36,801 --> 00:00:39,000
We think that if people could
just loosen up a little bit

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,100
and, you know,
or maybe type 5% faster,

18
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,400
then that's 5% less time
that they spend typing.

19
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,734
So I'll start with an example.

20
00:00:45,734 --> 00:00:47,801
It's probably the easiest way
to explain.

21
00:00:47,801 --> 00:00:51,133
Let's say you want to meet up
with one of your friends.

22
00:00:51,133 --> 00:00:52,300
You're having a chat.

23
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,534
So you write...

24
00:00:54,534 --> 00:00:56,467
Let's...

25
00:00:56,467 --> 00:00:58,434
met...

26
00:00:58,434 --> 00:01:00,067
whoops...

27
00:01:00,067 --> 00:01:03,767
tomorrow.

28
00:01:03,767 --> 00:01:05,567
So here you see
I've made a mistake.

29
00:01:05,567 --> 00:01:07,400
I've written met
instead of meet here.

30
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,501
My finger slipped on the "e."

31
00:01:09,501 --> 00:01:13,534
So now, the way that we
implemented spelling

32
00:01:13,534 --> 00:01:16,968
is we introduced an automatic
participant called Spelly

33
00:01:16,968 --> 00:01:19,767
who works just like
another user

34
00:01:19,767 --> 00:01:21,767
that's participating
on the wave with you.

35
00:01:21,767 --> 00:01:24,334
So Spelly's on your wave
with you,

36
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:29,267
and it can see that you've
typed "Let's met tomorrow,"

37
00:01:29,267 --> 00:01:31,367
and it's now gonna try
and spell-check it.

38
00:01:31,367 --> 00:01:32,901
For each word...

39
00:01:32,901 --> 00:01:35,534
it doesn't have any kind
of dictionary,

40
00:01:35,534 --> 00:01:39,534
so it doesn't know whether
met is a well-spelled word

41
00:01:39,534 --> 00:01:40,834
or a misspelling.

42
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:43,100
So to start with,
it comes up with a list

43
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,634
of possible candidate
corrections for this word.

44
00:01:46,634 --> 00:01:50,367
So some examples of that
might be...

45
00:01:50,367 --> 00:01:53,400
meat, the food...

46
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,868
or meet, the correctly
spelled version of this.

47
00:01:56,868 --> 00:01:59,367
And you can imagine
lots of others.

48
00:01:59,367 --> 00:02:02,200
So set or net or me--

49
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,367
all kinds of different words
that we would evaluate

50
00:02:05,367 --> 00:02:09,200
to see whether they're what
you actually meant to type.

51
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,734
We've learned from the web

52
00:02:12,734 --> 00:02:14,934
the kind of misspellings
that people make

53
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:17,200
and which things
are more and less likely.

54
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,834
So we know that,
for instance,

55
00:02:18,834 --> 00:02:20,634
maybe slipping
and inserting an "A"

56
00:02:20,634 --> 00:02:22,300
is relatively likely,

57
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,434
but misspelling
the very first letter

58
00:02:25,434 --> 00:02:28,467
might be less likely
in this case.

59
00:02:28,467 --> 00:02:32,667
So we've got some suggestions,
and the next thing that we do

60
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:34,667
is evaluate these suggestions
in context.

61
00:02:34,667 --> 00:02:38,067
So there are other systems
at Google that already use

62
00:02:38,067 --> 00:02:40,434
the same kind of statistical
language models as this,

63
00:02:40,434 --> 00:02:42,467
such as the Google
translation system,

64
00:02:42,467 --> 00:02:44,367
that essentially
encode information

65
00:02:44,367 --> 00:02:46,133
about how language is used.

66
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:47,968
These are learned from the web

67
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:49,734
from looking at billions
of web pages,

68
00:02:49,734 --> 00:02:51,167
so we get a really good idea

69
00:02:51,167 --> 00:02:53,734
about the way that people
really use language in practice.

70
00:02:53,734 --> 00:02:55,434
So what we would do

71
00:02:55,434 --> 00:02:58,834
is look at the likelihood
of "Let's met tomorrow"

72
00:02:58,834 --> 00:03:02,067
and "Let's meat tomorrow,"
less likely,

73
00:03:02,067 --> 00:03:03,767
and "Let's meet tomorrow,"

74
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:06,267
which is gonna be more likely
than either of these.

75
00:03:06,267 --> 00:03:08,067
And we combine that
with our error model

76
00:03:08,067 --> 00:03:10,200
which tells us how likely
the misspellings are,

77
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,834
you know, without any context,
to get a final determination

78
00:03:13,834 --> 00:03:15,901
as to what are
the most likely words--

79
00:03:15,901 --> 00:03:19,200
most likely word
that you meant right here.

80
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,000
So in this case,
we would suggest meet.

81
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,467
Once we think
that a word is misspelled,

82
00:03:25,467 --> 00:03:29,100
we need to get that back
to the Google Wave client

83
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,667
so that the user
can actually see it

84
00:03:31,667 --> 00:03:34,701
and either correct it
automatically or manually.

85
00:03:34,701 --> 00:03:36,067
Two kinds of ways

86
00:03:36,067 --> 00:03:38,834
that this differs
from existing spelling systems.

87
00:03:38,834 --> 00:03:42,000
One of them is just that
it's hosted.

88
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,100
And this means that we can do

89
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,033
this same kind of spelling
for you,

90
00:03:46,033 --> 00:03:49,434
regardless of which device
you're connecting from.

91
00:03:49,434 --> 00:03:52,767
So whether you're on your laptop
or your mobile or your desktop,

92
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:56,000
we can give the same
quality spelling, regardless.

93
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,901
And that applies
across languages too,

94
00:03:57,901 --> 00:03:59,467
so, you know, we're doing this

95
00:03:59,467 --> 00:04:01,267
for other alphabetic
languages also.

96
00:04:01,267 --> 00:04:06,667
So like I said, we use large
statistical language models.

97
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:07,801
When I said large, you know,

98
00:04:07,801 --> 00:04:09,801
we train them
from billions of words.

99
00:04:09,801 --> 00:04:12,033
They end up being
many, many gigabytes.

100
00:04:12,033 --> 00:04:15,501
It's pretty infeasible to run
these on a single machine,

101
00:04:15,501 --> 00:04:17,601
which isn't such a problem
in a data center

102
00:04:17,601 --> 00:04:19,234
where you can have
a set of machines

103
00:04:19,234 --> 00:04:22,200
running a language model
and a spelling model together.

104
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:27,167
And then we can share
that spelling model

105
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:28,734
between many users

106
00:04:28,734 --> 00:04:30,667
so that the cost per user
is very low.

107
00:04:30,667 --> 00:04:33,534
So it's very efficient
for us to do this.

108
00:04:33,534 --> 00:04:35,667
Once you realize
that you've got a system

109
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:37,801
that supports
collaborative editing,

110
00:04:37,801 --> 00:04:39,501
that has structured data,

111
00:04:39,501 --> 00:04:42,667
and that you can change
the user interface

112
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:45,167
by having remote participants,

113
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:47,200
then, really,
the sky's the limit.

114
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,434
I mean, there's all kinds
of existing

115
00:04:49,434 --> 00:04:51,400
natural language technologies
like spell checking

116
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,100
or translation
that we can apply,

117
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,667
and we're seeing
a lot of new applications

118
00:04:55,667 --> 00:04:57,667
as the way that we communicate
changes as well.

119
00:04:57,667 --> 00:05:00,868
So, you know, really,
it's gonna be exciting times.
