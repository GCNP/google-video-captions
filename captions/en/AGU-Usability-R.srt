1
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,067
man: Okay, so for our next talk,

2
00:00:29,067 --> 00:00:31,000
we have Rich Treves,

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,767
who is at the, uh,
geography department

4
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:37,334
at the university
of Southhampton in England,

5
00:00:37,334 --> 00:00:39,767
where he's a, uh, general
sort of researcher

6
00:00:39,767 --> 00:00:41,434
and educator,

7
00:00:41,434 --> 00:00:44,601
and does a lot of work
in the area of

8
00:00:44,601 --> 00:00:46,200
Google Earth, Google Maps,

9
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,767
and how best to use them
and design the things

10
00:00:49,767 --> 00:00:51,367
that you're using them.

11
00:00:51,367 --> 00:00:53,767
He maintains a blog
called Google Earth Design.

12
00:00:53,767 --> 00:00:56,400
And so today, he's gonna
talk about GeoWeb

13
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:02,834
and its usability.

14
00:01:02,834 --> 00:01:04,467
Treves: Thanks, John.

15
00:01:04,467 --> 00:01:07,767
Um, so, yeah, there's
the front screen.

16
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:09,834
And, uh, I'll tell you what
I'm gonna go through

17
00:01:09,834 --> 00:01:11,767
in the talk today.

18
00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:14,067
Um, first of all, I'm gonna
go off on a complete tangent

19
00:01:14,067 --> 00:01:16,234
and talk about polygons
and how much I like them

20
00:01:16,234 --> 00:01:19,534
and we should use them more
in Google Earth.

21
00:01:19,534 --> 00:01:22,367
Um, then I'm gonna come on
to the big challenge

22
00:01:22,367 --> 00:01:24,834
of the 21st century, I think,
for the human race,

23
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:26,767
which is global warming

24
00:01:26,767 --> 00:01:30,200
and how this relates
to Google Earth.

25
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,400
Then I'm gonna talk about
are we misusing the GeoWeb?

26
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,234
I mean this
in terms of design.

27
00:01:35,234 --> 00:01:37,434
I mean this in terms of
design of the people

28
00:01:37,434 --> 00:01:39,167
putting this into Google Earth

29
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:40,767
rather than the actual design
of Google Earth

30
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,100
or any of the other
virtual globes

31
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,701
or Google map-type tools.

32
00:01:45,701 --> 00:01:47,767
And to do this,
I'm gonna explore lessons

33
00:01:47,767 --> 00:01:49,067
from other technologies,

34
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,767
so I'm gonna talk about
some other technologies

35
00:01:50,767 --> 00:01:52,567
and how they developed.

36
00:01:52,567 --> 00:01:54,400
Uh, I'm gonna de--
deconstruct

37
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,734
a couple of projects

38
00:01:55,734 --> 00:01:59,133
from a design
point of view, so...

39
00:01:59,133 --> 00:02:02,334
Okay, so here I go,
off on my tangent.

40
00:02:02,334 --> 00:02:04,601
Uh, polygons rock.
They're really good.

41
00:02:04,601 --> 00:02:07,734
Um...what happens is if--

42
00:02:07,734 --> 00:02:09,834
if you look at Google Earth,
you'll see there's lots

43
00:02:09,834 --> 00:02:11,601
of content which has--

44
00:02:11,601 --> 00:02:13,367
which is in the form
of place marks.

45
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:14,767
The place marks
are a very common way

46
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:17,767
of putting information
in Google Earth and...

47
00:02:17,767 --> 00:02:21,834
Oop.

48
00:02:21,834 --> 00:02:23,634
There's one there.

49
00:02:23,634 --> 00:02:26,501
That's the, uh, Albert Memorial
in Hyde Park in London.

50
00:02:26,501 --> 00:02:31,200
And I mention this one because
I did a--

51
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,100
a teaching exercise in London

52
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,534
at the royal
geographical society,

53
00:02:34,534 --> 00:02:36,167
which is very close to this.

54
00:02:36,167 --> 00:02:39,067
And I had to teach them
about how to use GPS.

55
00:02:39,067 --> 00:02:40,634
And I gave them GPSs
and I said,

56
00:02:40,634 --> 00:02:43,334
"go out and mark
the Albert Memorial,"

57
00:02:43,334 --> 00:02:45,100
and the picture of it
is down there.

58
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,701
And what I didn't say,

59
00:02:46,701 --> 00:02:48,167
and I deliberately
didn't tell them

60
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:49,400
is how they were
supposed to mark it.

61
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,033
So I showed them
how to mark points.

62
00:02:51,033 --> 00:02:53,133
And I said,
"just go out and mark it

63
00:02:53,133 --> 00:02:55,701
the best way you think."

64
00:02:55,701 --> 00:02:57,467
and what they did
is they actually went out

65
00:02:57,467 --> 00:02:59,234
and marked a polygon.

66
00:02:59,234 --> 00:03:01,467
So they actually went out
and they marked that square

67
00:03:01,467 --> 00:03:03,834
rather than marking it
as a point.

68
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:05,634
Which tells you that it--

69
00:03:05,634 --> 00:03:07,434
these are social scientists
I was talking to.

70
00:03:07,434 --> 00:03:10,234
They aren't big on GIS
or anything.

71
00:03:10,234 --> 00:03:13,334
And they just get the idea
that, actually,

72
00:03:13,334 --> 00:03:15,567
the picture you can see,
the Albert Memorial,

73
00:03:15,567 --> 00:03:17,334
isn't a point.

74
00:03:17,334 --> 00:03:20,467
It's more than a point.
It's actually an area.

75
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:22,767
And the way it works
in GIS

76
00:03:22,767 --> 00:03:26,033
is lots of data is held
in polygons

77
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:27,767
as tables of data.

78
00:03:27,767 --> 00:03:29,434
So there's
multiple bits of data

79
00:03:29,434 --> 00:03:32,334
held within polygons.

80
00:03:32,334 --> 00:03:37,033
Um, I thought I'd better
show you a better example.

81
00:03:37,033 --> 00:03:40,400
So in GIS, as I said,
polygons are a lot more common.

82
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,200
Uh, this is an image
of Big Island Hawaii.

83
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,267
And its lava flows
you can see in color

84
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:49,234
coming down the Mauna Loa
volcano there.

85
00:03:49,234 --> 00:03:51,634
And each of those has to be
a polygon.

86
00:03:51,634 --> 00:03:56,033
You can't mark those different
historical flows of lava

87
00:03:56,033 --> 00:03:57,200
as a point.

88
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,467
And there's lots of analysis

89
00:03:58,467 --> 00:04:01,133
for things like
volcanic hazard go on

90
00:04:01,133 --> 00:04:02,300
with that sort of data.

91
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,834
So it's held in
a GIS system.

92
00:04:04,834 --> 00:04:06,467
And what goes with polygons

93
00:04:06,467 --> 00:04:08,334
is what's called
an attribute table.

94
00:04:08,334 --> 00:04:10,834
So there's lots--there's a whole
table full of data.

95
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:13,467
I actually just pulled an image
of any old attribute table,

96
00:04:13,467 --> 00:04:16,234
so they don't actually
match up here.

97
00:04:16,234 --> 00:04:18,834
But, uh, you can see
that you have rows,

98
00:04:18,834 --> 00:04:22,100
which is--each polygon
has a set of data

99
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,400
and you have
the attributes there.

100
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,000
So what I've highlighted there
is slope.

101
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,767
So each of those lava flows
you can imagine having a slope.

102
00:04:29,767 --> 00:04:32,634
And that helps in the modeling
of where lava will go

103
00:04:32,634 --> 00:04:34,567
in the future.

104
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:37,000
And there's an esri Google
tie-up now,

105
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,567
and what I'm pondering,

106
00:04:38,567 --> 00:04:40,701
and I'd be interested
to know the answer to,

107
00:04:40,701 --> 00:04:45,767
is how all the data
that's held as polygons

108
00:04:45,767 --> 00:04:48,767
in attribute table is gonna get
transferred into Google

109
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:51,367
if we don't start
using polygons more.

110
00:04:51,367 --> 00:04:55,367
And when I talk to GIS people
about Google Earth,

111
00:04:55,367 --> 00:04:56,767
the thing they often
come up with

112
00:04:56,767 --> 00:04:58,734
is they start talking
about polygons

113
00:04:58,734 --> 00:05:01,834
and how it's the central way
that they control data.

114
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:04,834
Okay, so briefly,
what can you do with this?

115
00:05:04,834 --> 00:05:07,300
Well, uh, I've had a go
at building a tool

116
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,634
that works with Google Earth,

117
00:05:08,634 --> 00:05:10,834
and this is just
some sample data.

118
00:05:10,834 --> 00:05:12,634
I've produced
some random polygons.

119
00:05:12,634 --> 00:05:14,834
They could be administered
regions, whatever.

120
00:05:14,834 --> 00:05:17,701
And this is in
the Darfur region.

121
00:05:17,701 --> 00:05:21,234
And the yellow and orange marks
you can see there,

122
00:05:21,234 --> 00:05:24,534
those are, um, damaged villages
in Darfur,

123
00:05:24,534 --> 00:05:27,367
and the red flames
are destroyed images.

124
00:05:27,367 --> 00:05:29,767
And I just counted them up
and attached in a table

125
00:05:29,767 --> 00:05:31,534
to those polygons.

126
00:05:31,534 --> 00:05:36,634
And it allows you to produce
thematic map--

127
00:05:36,634 --> 00:05:38,367
thematic maps.

128
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:41,767
Um, and you can then,
with the tool that we produced,

129
00:05:41,767 --> 00:05:43,767
you can automatically color them
in different ways

130
00:05:43,767 --> 00:05:45,734
on the fly in Google Earth.

131
00:05:45,734 --> 00:05:47,734
So in all kinds of teaching
situations,

132
00:05:47,734 --> 00:05:49,701
that's a--a useful thing.

133
00:05:49,701 --> 00:05:51,133
I'm not gonna go into
the technical details

134
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:52,567
of how you did that.

135
00:05:52,567 --> 00:05:54,567
If someone wants to ask me
afterwards, I'll tell them.

136
00:05:54,567 --> 00:05:56,734
Um, but the nice thing is,

137
00:05:56,734 --> 00:05:59,067
I just got some
successful funding through

138
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,300
to play around with this,

139
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,968
and the tool I produced

140
00:06:01,968 --> 00:06:03,868
wasn't in a form
that I could release.

141
00:06:03,868 --> 00:06:06,734
And what we're gonna go on
is produce a customization

142
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:09,367
of Google Maps and play around
with this idea some more.

143
00:06:09,367 --> 00:06:12,334
So you'll see some more things
about this in the future.

144
00:06:12,334 --> 00:06:15,033
Okay, so on to the talk
proper, really.

145
00:06:15,033 --> 00:06:19,234
And to talk about, um,

146
00:06:19,234 --> 00:06:21,167
usability,
GeoWeb usability.

147
00:06:21,167 --> 00:06:23,300
How to design things well
to go into

148
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,934
GeoWeb applications.

149
00:06:26,934 --> 00:06:28,601
And off, really,
on another tangent here.

150
00:06:28,601 --> 00:06:30,834
This is from a drugs education
project

151
00:06:30,834 --> 00:06:32,367
in the U.K. I heard about.

152
00:06:32,367 --> 00:06:35,734
And they gave out pencils as
part of their drugs education

153
00:06:35,734 --> 00:06:38,734
with that message on, saying,
"It's cool not to do drugs."

154
00:06:38,734 --> 00:06:40,968
Now, the thing about pencils
is you sharpen them,

155
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:43,000
and letters disappear.

156
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,567
In which case, the message
of course changes a little.

157
00:06:46,567 --> 00:06:48,300
And then you sharpen it
a bit more,

158
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,067
and it gets even more emphatic
about what you should do.

159
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:53,400
So they printed up
loads of these pencils

160
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,734
and sent them out.

161
00:06:54,734 --> 00:06:58,667
And then, of course, they had
to not use them again.

162
00:06:58,667 --> 00:07:01,200
Which goes to prove
a great saying of mine

163
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,701
in most of what I do,
which is,

164
00:07:02,701 --> 00:07:05,901
"Just because we can
does not mean we should."

165
00:07:05,901 --> 00:07:08,033
Which is a very cheeky
thing to do, to say,

166
00:07:08,033 --> 00:07:09,868
actually standing
in a Google office

167
00:07:09,868 --> 00:07:12,033
built on things
which are very good

168
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:13,367
for very good reasons.

169
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:17,567
Um...so that's
a kind of back story.

170
00:07:17,567 --> 00:07:19,767
The 21st century challenge,
I think,

171
00:07:19,767 --> 00:07:22,868
uh, the central challenge
of our time

172
00:07:22,868 --> 00:07:24,801
is going to be
global warming.

173
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:29,901
And as a scientist who works
with scientists as well,

174
00:07:29,901 --> 00:07:32,267
it's communicating science
change to the public.

175
00:07:32,267 --> 00:07:34,100
We have to have them
understand what's going on

176
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,567
to make decisions.

177
00:07:35,567 --> 00:07:37,767
Because if we don't persuade
them to stop using planes,

178
00:07:37,767 --> 00:07:39,901
we're not going to solve
global warming.

179
00:07:39,901 --> 00:07:42,067
So it's the central challenge.

180
00:07:42,067 --> 00:07:44,400
And I think the GeoWeb
is the key tool

181
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,100
in that battle
of trying to explain

182
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:51,167
global warming science
to the public.

183
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:52,634
And David Attenborough.

184
00:07:52,634 --> 00:07:54,067
I saw him at a Google Earth--

185
00:07:54,067 --> 00:07:56,367
uh, Google outreach launch
in London.

186
00:07:56,367 --> 00:07:58,534
Put this a lot better
than I ever could.

187
00:07:58,534 --> 00:08:00,300
And he said Google Earth is

188
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,901
"a weapon of unparalleled value
in the hands of all of us

189
00:08:02,901 --> 00:08:07,100
who care about this greatly
imperiled world."

190
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,868
so, uh, that's the importance.
That's what we're going for.

191
00:08:09,868 --> 00:08:13,834
That's why considering these
is particularly important,

192
00:08:13,834 --> 00:08:16,567
I think,
in solving these problems.

193
00:08:16,567 --> 00:08:19,734
Okay, so I said I'd talk
about other technologies

194
00:08:19,734 --> 00:08:22,667
and what lessons we could learn
from other technologies.

195
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:25,200
This gartner's hype cycle,

196
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,267
and it applies to some
technologies, as I said.

197
00:08:27,267 --> 00:08:28,934
Not all of them,
but lots of them go through

198
00:08:28,934 --> 00:08:30,267
this sort of thing.

199
00:08:30,267 --> 00:08:32,234
And what you've got
on the left axis

200
00:08:32,234 --> 00:08:33,334
is visibility.

201
00:08:33,334 --> 00:08:36,501
So the visibility
of the technology

202
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:39,133
and time on the bottom axis.

203
00:08:39,133 --> 00:08:42,000
And obviously, start with,
there's no technology invented.

204
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,667
And then it's invented.

205
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:46,434
So you have the technology
trigger.

206
00:08:46,434 --> 00:08:50,501
And then everyone gets
very overexcited about it.

207
00:08:50,501 --> 00:08:53,167
And then they realize that they
got overexcited about it,

208
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:55,834
and actually it doesn't work
in ways people thought it would.

209
00:08:55,834 --> 00:09:00,000
And then finally, people work
out how to use things well.

210
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,767
And we end up with a platter
of productivity.

211
00:09:02,767 --> 00:09:06,167
Now, I like this, but I think
it's a bit overcomplicated.

212
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:07,901
So to explain it in a short
period of time,

213
00:09:07,901 --> 00:09:09,234
I've kind of simplified it.

214
00:09:09,234 --> 00:09:12,234
And I just go with,
there's the old.

215
00:09:12,234 --> 00:09:15,400
There's the wrong.

216
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,601
And there's the right.

217
00:09:17,601 --> 00:09:21,467
So let's have a look
at some technologies.

218
00:09:21,467 --> 00:09:24,567
Watches, and I'm gonna have some
audience participation here.

219
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:26,534
So old.

220
00:09:26,534 --> 00:09:28,834
This is a mechanical watch.

221
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:30,901
It's got no battery in it.
You had to wind it up.

222
00:09:30,901 --> 00:09:32,334
It's all little cogs
and wheels.

223
00:09:32,334 --> 00:09:35,901
Does anyone in the audience have
a purely mechanical watch?

224
00:09:35,901 --> 00:09:38,200
- Nope, no one.
- Not on me.

225
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,067
Not on you, okay.

226
00:09:40,067 --> 00:09:41,834
Good, nothing wrong
with an old watch.

227
00:09:41,834 --> 00:09:44,300
But it's expensive
for what it does,

228
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,667
and you need to wind it.

229
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:49,234
This is wrong.

230
00:09:49,234 --> 00:09:50,434
Now, this is a digital watch.

231
00:09:50,434 --> 00:09:52,033
This is a particular type
of digital watch

232
00:09:52,033 --> 00:09:53,634
that came out in the 70s.

233
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:54,834
And to actually
get the display,

234
00:09:54,834 --> 00:09:57,767
you had to press the button
to see the time.

235
00:09:57,767 --> 00:09:59,801
Does anyone
have one of those?

236
00:09:59,801 --> 00:10:02,801
Okay, I'm glad, 'cause I'm
saying that's wrong and really--

237
00:10:02,801 --> 00:10:05,200
people could just
for stylistic reasons like it.

238
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,300
But you had to press it
to find out the time,

239
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,267
so you couldn't glance at your
watch surreptitiously

240
00:10:09,267 --> 00:10:10,567
in a meeting where
you're getting bored

241
00:10:10,567 --> 00:10:13,100
and find out
what time it was.

242
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,501
And finally, now we've got
things like this,

243
00:10:15,501 --> 00:10:18,701
which is a mixed
digital-analog watch.

244
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:19,868
So whatever takes your fancy,

245
00:10:19,868 --> 00:10:21,367
whether you like analog
or digital,

246
00:10:21,367 --> 00:10:22,400
you can glance at it.

247
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,901
It's always on.

248
00:10:23,901 --> 00:10:25,501
It's battery powered.
You don't have to wind it up.

249
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:27,567
And it's much cheaper
to produce

250
00:10:27,567 --> 00:10:31,267
than the mechanical watch.

251
00:10:31,267 --> 00:10:33,601
And I also like that example,
because it allows me

252
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:40,534
to use this rather nice quote.

253
00:10:40,534 --> 00:10:43,200
Okay, another one--
information index.

254
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,901
So books, books have indexes.

255
00:10:45,901 --> 00:10:49,467
There are indexes of books.

256
00:10:49,467 --> 00:10:51,734
The web came out, and we all
got really excited

257
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,701
about indexes and hyperlinks.

258
00:10:53,701 --> 00:10:55,934
But sometimes the hyperlinks
were done really badly

259
00:10:55,934 --> 00:10:57,567
and the indexing was done
really badly.

260
00:10:57,567 --> 00:11:00,968
So this is a particularly bad
web page in terms of design.

261
00:11:00,968 --> 00:11:03,367
Because it's got an index,
and it links quite nicely

262
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:05,100
and that all works,
thank you very much.

263
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,033
But you can't see it because
of the terrible colors

264
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:08,567
that are being used
in the banding.

265
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,601
And I'm not gonna actually
show you the web page.

266
00:11:10,601 --> 00:11:11,801
But if we could see it,

267
00:11:11,801 --> 00:11:14,200
the guy has actually
animated those colors

268
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,767
so they move.

269
00:11:15,767 --> 00:11:17,467
Um, and it would give you all
headaches,

270
00:11:17,467 --> 00:11:19,334
so I'm not
showing you that.

271
00:11:19,334 --> 00:11:22,601
And, right,
this is my home page.

272
00:11:22,601 --> 00:11:25,300
That's what pops up when I open
firefox every morning.

273
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,901
It's Google reader.
It's indexed everything.

274
00:11:27,901 --> 00:11:29,234
It works, it looks nice.

275
00:11:29,234 --> 00:11:32,667
I understand what's
going on with it.

276
00:11:32,667 --> 00:11:35,634
So that's a particular aspect,
really,

277
00:11:35,634 --> 00:11:37,300
of the web
I was talking about there.

278
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,234
Jakob Nielsen, who's a web
usability expert,

279
00:11:40,234 --> 00:11:44,200
uh, said that the lost decade
of the web

280
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,567
was approximately
1993 to 2003,

281
00:11:47,567 --> 00:11:49,367
when he says
that in those years,

282
00:11:49,367 --> 00:11:53,400
web design was actually
abominable.

283
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,801
Um, so my thesis is that,
really, we're going through

284
00:11:56,801 --> 00:11:59,667
a kind of a lost decade
of GeoWeb design,

285
00:11:59,667 --> 00:12:01,033
'cause people
really haven't learned

286
00:12:01,033 --> 00:12:03,400
to use
this technology properly.

287
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,234
And my arguments with watches
and the web

288
00:12:06,234 --> 00:12:07,367
is not a tight argument,

289
00:12:07,367 --> 00:12:09,300
and I'll just try to put
the idea across.

290
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,868
So if anyone thinks of some
holes with those arguments,

291
00:12:11,868 --> 00:12:14,367
that's fair enough.

292
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:16,200
But as I said,
the central question is

293
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,434
"are we in the wrong phase?"

294
00:12:17,434 --> 00:12:20,200
Are we in the lost decade
of the GeoWeb?

295
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,200
So let's go in
and look at an example.

296
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,400
This is the hurricane hunters.

297
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,133
And what you're
looking at there,

298
00:12:27,133 --> 00:12:31,801
that's an image of a plane track
that's going across,

299
00:12:31,801 --> 00:12:33,801
and these people take
wind measurements

300
00:12:33,801 --> 00:12:36,067
as the hurricane comes in.

301
00:12:36,067 --> 00:12:37,400
And they record them.

302
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,667
And this person
has published this.

303
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:42,300
I don't want to embarrass
anyone,

304
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,667
so I'm not gonna say
who it is.

305
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:45,067
But it's just
I'm pointing out

306
00:12:45,067 --> 00:12:47,567
some of the common mistakes
that get made.

307
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:50,133
Um, and so they
put it together,

308
00:12:50,133 --> 00:12:51,467
and here are
some obvious things

309
00:12:51,467 --> 00:12:53,033
that aren't really
working with this.

310
00:12:53,033 --> 00:12:54,234
First of all,
in the scale there,

311
00:12:54,234 --> 00:12:56,801
the scale isn't
an obvious blend.

312
00:12:56,801 --> 00:12:58,801
What it's showing you
is wind speed,

313
00:12:58,801 --> 00:13:02,267
but red has appeared twice in
the scale in different places.

314
00:13:02,267 --> 00:13:04,067
So you look at red,
you don't immediately know

315
00:13:04,067 --> 00:13:07,367
what wind speed
is referring to.

316
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:09,868
Those icons--I've expanded one
in the top left.

317
00:13:09,868 --> 00:13:13,200
That's a standard wind icon on
meteorological maps.

318
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,901
And it works
when it's one icon

319
00:13:15,901 --> 00:13:17,200
separated by lots of space,

320
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,033
which is what you usually
have on weather maps.

321
00:13:19,033 --> 00:13:20,968
In this case, you've got
lots of them packed together,

322
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:22,367
and you can't see them.

323
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:24,501
They all squish up.

324
00:13:24,501 --> 00:13:27,567
So what I did is I did
another version of it.

325
00:13:27,567 --> 00:13:29,234
And I tried
to improve the design.

326
00:13:29,234 --> 00:13:30,434
And what I did,
first of all,

327
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:31,801
I've cleaned up
the scale there,

328
00:13:31,801 --> 00:13:33,467
so it's a standard
heat map scale.

329
00:13:33,467 --> 00:13:36,467
So you can instantly get
an idea of wind speed.

330
00:13:36,467 --> 00:13:39,167
And the wind speed isn't within
the icon anymore.

331
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:42,868
It's the--the color
of the line there.

332
00:13:42,868 --> 00:13:44,868
And also, what I've done
with the icon

333
00:13:44,868 --> 00:13:47,968
is they're little black slugs
with white halos around them.

334
00:13:47,968 --> 00:13:50,467
And that means on any background
they will pop up,

335
00:13:50,467 --> 00:13:51,934
and you'll be able
to see them.

336
00:13:51,934 --> 00:13:53,534
And you can't control
what background

337
00:13:53,534 --> 00:13:55,367
things plot over in
in Google Earth,

338
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,067
so that's a good
design point.

339
00:13:57,067 --> 00:13:58,567
You can also see
that the line

340
00:13:58,567 --> 00:14:00,501
has got a gray halo
around it, also,

341
00:14:00,501 --> 00:14:03,667
to make it stand out.

342
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:07,000
So I hope you can see,
from common sense point of view,

343
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,567
that makes it a lot more easy.

344
00:14:08,567 --> 00:14:10,567
Oh, and I cleared up
the number of, uh,

345
00:14:10,567 --> 00:14:12,067
place marks as well.

346
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:14,667
I took a lot of them out,
so it's not a crowded view.

347
00:14:14,667 --> 00:14:17,434
This not an isolated case,
and it's just one

348
00:14:17,434 --> 00:14:19,567
where there was a number
of things wrong all at once.

349
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:23,434
And I see lots of--lots
of design problems like this

350
00:14:23,434 --> 00:14:26,834
all over--all over
the GeoWeb, really.

351
00:14:26,834 --> 00:14:28,868
Moving over
to the "places" column,

352
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,100
I'm not gonna talk
much about this,

353
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,934
but one thing you can
instantly see

354
00:14:32,934 --> 00:14:34,701
is if you're a member
of the public

355
00:14:34,701 --> 00:14:36,334
who really doesn't
know about this data,

356
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:39,234
that's a very complicated
set of folders and structures,

357
00:14:39,234 --> 00:14:43,868
and the icons with the circles
and the holes in them.

358
00:14:43,868 --> 00:14:45,400
If you haven't used
Google Earth a lot,

359
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,901
you don't know what it is.

360
00:14:46,901 --> 00:14:50,634
Um, so my version,
I just simplified things,

361
00:14:50,634 --> 00:14:52,434
and you can see
in the places column there

362
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:54,801
I've just got a--

363
00:14:54,801 --> 00:14:59,367
a set of very simple layers
to click though.

364
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:02,667
So I'm standing up here
talking about design,

365
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:04,067
but there are lot of things

366
00:15:04,067 --> 00:15:05,467
that Treves
does not understand.

367
00:15:05,467 --> 00:15:07,400
There's a lot of things
I don't get.

368
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,300
And the central thing is:

369
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,834
my criticisms
when I talk about these things,

370
00:15:12,834 --> 00:15:14,767
when I write about
these things on my blog,

371
00:15:14,767 --> 00:15:17,634
I'm drawing analogies
from web design

372
00:15:17,634 --> 00:15:18,734
and from static
graphic design

373
00:15:18,734 --> 00:15:22,601
and applying them
to the GeoWeb.

374
00:15:22,601 --> 00:15:24,167
I'm not sure that works.

375
00:15:24,167 --> 00:15:26,868
I'm not sure you can
do that straight off.

376
00:15:26,868 --> 00:15:29,434
Other things is
if you improve the design

377
00:15:29,434 --> 00:15:31,501
in the ways I've described,

378
00:15:31,501 --> 00:15:34,200
does it make it for the users
a more memorable thing?

379
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,167
Does it make it
more interesting?

380
00:15:36,167 --> 00:15:38,167
Does it mean they spend
more time on the site

381
00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:39,300
looking at it?

382
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,033
All these questions,
I don't know.

383
00:15:41,033 --> 00:15:43,968
So, uh, I've been
in negotiations,

384
00:15:43,968 --> 00:15:45,300
and I've now just got
a fellowship

385
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,901
sorted with SPLINT,

386
00:15:46,901 --> 00:15:48,834
which is a consortium
of british universities,

387
00:15:48,834 --> 00:15:51,100
and we're gonna investigate some
of these things

388
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,701
and answer
some of these questions.

389
00:15:54,701 --> 00:15:56,167
So, to conclude,

390
00:15:56,167 --> 00:15:58,868
that's my, um, blog.

391
00:15:58,868 --> 00:16:00,267
That's the address of my blog

392
00:16:00,267 --> 00:16:03,701
if you're interested in reading
any more about this.

393
00:16:03,701 --> 00:16:05,267
First of all,
I was talking about

394
00:16:05,267 --> 00:16:08,267
just because we can
doesn't mean we should.

395
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:11,133
And I went off on a tangent
and talked about polygons

396
00:16:11,133 --> 00:16:12,467
and how I think
they're something

397
00:16:12,467 --> 00:16:14,734
that we should be using more of
in Google Earth.

398
00:16:14,734 --> 00:16:16,501
And then I said
an essential thing

399
00:16:16,501 --> 00:16:18,868
we have as a challenge
in the 21st century

400
00:16:18,868 --> 00:16:20,167
is climate change

401
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:23,100
and communicating
the science of climate change.

402
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:28,000
And I compared, really,
the old wrong-right...

403
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,367
um, phases
of some technologies.

404
00:16:30,367 --> 00:16:32,167
And I said
just as digital watches

405
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:33,434
have largely disappeared,

406
00:16:33,434 --> 00:16:36,467
the ones that you have to press
to see the time.

407
00:16:36,467 --> 00:16:39,467
So I think we've got a phase
here of design

408
00:16:39,467 --> 00:16:41,501
and people not understanding
design well

409
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,234
and having to communicate
with the public,

410
00:16:43,234 --> 00:16:47,734
particularly using tools
like Google Earth.

411
00:16:47,734 --> 00:16:49,100
And, really,
the last thing,

412
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,634
I'd like to return to what
David Attenborough said.

413
00:16:52,634 --> 00:16:53,901
And if you remember,
he said,

414
00:16:53,901 --> 00:16:56,934
we live in a greatly
imperiled world.

415
00:16:56,934 --> 00:17:01,067
And we have in Google Earth
a weapon of unparalleled value

416
00:17:01,067 --> 00:17:02,167
for tackling that

417
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:03,801
and defending
that imperiled world.

418
00:17:03,801 --> 00:17:05,434
And my point, I think,
essentially,

419
00:17:05,434 --> 00:17:10,801
that now we need
to learn how to aim that weapon.

420
00:17:10,801 --> 00:17:15,167
[applause]

421
00:17:20,367 --> 00:17:22,667
man: You talk about
the period of time

422
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:26,734
where it was just a sort of
lost period of, um,

423
00:17:26,734 --> 00:17:29,267
of web design
in the late 1990s

424
00:17:29,267 --> 00:17:37,501
[man speaking indistinctly]

425
00:17:37,501 --> 00:17:41,033
and by extrapolation,
are we at that stage today?

426
00:17:41,033 --> 00:17:42,868
There's very few books...

427
00:17:42,868 --> 00:17:44,267
[man speaking indistinctly]

428
00:17:44,267 --> 00:17:45,567
but that may change.

429
00:17:45,567 --> 00:17:46,634
Treves: Yeah.

430
00:17:46,634 --> 00:17:49,501
The question was, um,

431
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:52,934
as I mentioned,
the lost decade of the web,

432
00:17:52,934 --> 00:17:54,100
are we in that now,

433
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,968
and is it a lack
of technical tools

434
00:17:55,968 --> 00:17:58,234
and, uh, direction,

435
00:17:58,234 --> 00:18:00,067
documentation
of how to design?

436
00:18:00,067 --> 00:18:01,767
I think you're exactly right.

437
00:18:01,767 --> 00:18:04,133
I don't think we're actually
lacking technical instruction

438
00:18:04,133 --> 00:18:05,868
and technical tools.

439
00:18:05,868 --> 00:18:07,300
I think they're all out there.

440
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,567
Um, but I think you're right.

441
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:10,334
It's lack of documentation.

442
00:18:10,334 --> 00:18:12,200
And I hope my blog is doing
something about that

443
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,734
as I'm talking about that.

444
00:18:14,734 --> 00:18:17,133
Um, but yes, I think
it's definitely a phase.

445
00:18:17,133 --> 00:18:18,634
I think we're gonna
go through it.

446
00:18:18,634 --> 00:18:21,834
And what I think is we are
gonna come out the other side,

447
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:24,334
but I prefer to get out there
before ten years is up.

448
00:18:24,334 --> 00:18:27,434
It'd be nice if we went through
in five years, so...

449
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,200
Okay?
