1
00:00:01,067 --> 00:00:02,434
One thing I really like
about Google Web Toolkit

2
00:00:02,434 --> 00:00:04,133
is hosted mode.

3
00:00:04,133 --> 00:00:05,734
Hosted mode
lets you execute

4
00:00:05,734 --> 00:00:07,567
your application's
Java code

5
00:00:07,567 --> 00:00:09,634
while it controls
an embedded browser.

6
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:12,133
You can make changes
to your Java on the fly,

7
00:00:12,133 --> 00:00:13,501
hit "refresh"
in the browser

8
00:00:13,501 --> 00:00:15,267
and see those changes
instantly.

9
00:00:15,267 --> 00:00:17,501
It really speeds up
our development cycle.

10
00:00:17,501 --> 00:00:19,567
One thing I'm really
looking forward to

11
00:00:19,567 --> 00:00:21,334
is out-of-process
hosted mode.

12
00:00:21,334 --> 00:00:23,868
This is going to let us
use a wider range of browsers

13
00:00:23,868 --> 00:00:26,200
for embedded testing.
