00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:01,968
Tomlinson: One thing
I found useful was reading

2
00:00:01,968 --> 00:00:04,601
through the SDK documentation
thoroughly,

3
00:00:04,601 --> 00:00:06,934
as well as doing the sample
applications provided,

4
00:00:06,934 --> 00:00:09,434
such as Hello World
and Notepad tutorial.

5
00:00:09,434 --> 00:00:10,667
They are really helpful.

6
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:12,033
There can be
a lot of information

7
00:00:12,033 --> 00:00:13,200
which is overwhelm--

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,033
overwhelming
to first-time developers,

9
00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:17,300
so reading
through the SDK documentation,

10
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,701
even though you have
an understanding,

11
00:00:18,701 --> 00:00:20,534
can be very helpful.

12
00:00:20,534 --> 00:00:21,667
I'd also like to point out

13
00:00:21,667 --> 00:00:22,968
the Apps
for Android project.

14
00:00:22,968 --> 00:00:25,100
Source code
is being provided by Google

15
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,601
to help
first-time developers

16
00:00:26,601 --> 00:00:28,801
overcome any hurdles
they may encounter

17
00:00:28,801 --> 00:00:30,767
while trying to develop
for Android,

18
00:00:30,767 --> 00:00:32,567
as well as having
some cool games on there.
