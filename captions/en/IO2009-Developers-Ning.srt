0:00:04.269,0:00:10.659
KEVIN MARKS: So, I'm here with two of the lead developers of Ning. Can you first explain what Ning is about, and what

0:00:10.659,0:00:11.009
you do?

0:00:11.010,0:00:17.679
KYLE FORD: Sure. So, Ning is a-- a platform, u-- upon which you can create your own social network for anything. So,

0:00:17.680,0:00:23.079
you can come there-- don't d-- don't have to be a super-nerd, or have any technical knowledge. You can just go there

0:00:23.079,0:00:27.819
and create-- a social network, really for any interest or passion in your life. So, it's a good range from, you know,

0:00:27.819,0:00:33.180
a small family group to-- a nonprofit that has a cause they wanna promote. (UNINTEL) get people, you know, aligned

0:00:33.180,0:00:37.270
with, al-- all the way up to large, you know, enter-- entertainment companies and media brands that wanna, you know,

0:00:37.270,0:00:43.430
have an official fan club or group. So-- we are adding a-- a-- I think between three and 4,000 new networks a day, so

0:00:43.430,0:00:48.430
growing very quickly. And we're at about 1.2-- million different networks that live on the platform-- (OVERTALK)

0:00:48.430,0:00:49.869
KYLE FORD: --today. Yeah.

0:00:49.869,0:00:52.959
KEVIN MARKS: So, effectively, when Ning joined Opensocial, we gave-- (OVERTALK)

0:00:52.959,0:00:55.020
KYLE FORD: That's exactly right, yeah.

0:00:55.020,0:00:55.680
ERNIE HSIUNG: Opportunity.

0:00:55.680,0:00:57.090
KEVIN MARKS: Opportunity. Though I think it was (UNINTEL)--(OVERTALK)

0:00:57.090,0:00:57.469
ERNIE HSIUNG: Yeah-- (OVERTALK)

0:00:57.469,0:00:58.379
KYLE FORD: --yeah. Yeah.

0:00:58.380,0:01:03.719
ERNIE HSIUNG: And th-- the reason why we're here at-- Google I/O is to talk a little bit about Ning past (?), which is

0:01:03.719,0:01:10.049
o-- open social applications that live on the main page of a social network, rather than on the profile page. And of

0:01:10.109,0:01:15.039
course, this means we're actually building some methods and kind of changing the spec just a little bit, to-- to make

0:01:15.199,0:01:23.009
s-- so the open social applications make the most s-- sense on the front page of a social network. But-- hopefully--

0:01:23.009,0:01:28.429
hopefully it'll be good, and-- we-- are looking to-- have it released some time in the next month.

0:01:28.429,0:01:29.239
KYLE FORD: Uh-huh (AFFIRM).

0:01:29.239,0:01:34.769
KEVIN MARKS: And so have you foun-- have you gotten a lot of uptake (?) from your developers on the vi-- individual

0:01:34.769,0:01:35.739
profile applications--(OVERTALK)

0:01:35.739,0:01:36.719
KYLE FORD: Yeah--

0:01:36.719,0:01:36.989
KEVIN MARKS: --first. I mean--(OVERTALK)

0:01:36.989,0:01:40.869
KYLE FORD: Yeah. I mean, we ha-- we have. It's certainly been something that we see, like, the more successful profile

0:01:40.869,0:01:45.389
apps (?) seem to be kind of more self-expression-oriented. You know, som-- something that makes sense on someone (?)

0:01:45.389,0:01:49.929
(UNINTEL) an individual page. You know, a-- applications that are more universal or functionality-based-- have been

0:01:49.929,0:01:54.329
successful, but I think are gonna be a lot more successful-- when it's, when they exist in the network level. Like,

0:01:54.329,0:01:58.159
for example, something like a shopping cart, I think makes a lot more sense as a network feature on a homepage than it

0:01:58.159,0:02:03.989
does on someone's in-- individual profile page. Whereas something like, you know, a buddy poke or a g-- or a game, you

0:02:03.989,0:02:08.069
know, can certainly be fine on a profile page. So, we're sort of, kind of gonna be not necessarily drawing a line in

0:02:08.069,0:02:12.960
the sand. We'll accept, you know, either for either. But I think we're gonna definitely s-- you know, slide what we're

0:02:12.960,0:02:18.029
calling profile apps now-- towards self-expression, and-- and Ning apps towards-- you know, functionality, or really--

0:02:18.910,0:02:22.509
almost replacement or ancillary features, you know, to our existing core features--

0:02:22.509,0:02:22.509
KEVIN MARKS: There's--

0:02:22.509,0:02:22.509
KYLE FORD: --so.

0:02:22.509,0:02:24.550
KEVIN MARKS: --a difference between apps for individuals and apps of groups?

0:02:24.550,0:02:25.080
KYLE FORD: Exactly-- (OVERTALK)

0:02:25.080,0:02:26.160
KYLE FORD: --exactly right, yeah.

0:02:26.160,0:02:29.169
ERNIE HSIUNG: We're-- we're-- we're tryin' to, we're tryin' to stretch the boundaries of open social applications, as

0:02:29.169,0:02:29.740
they exist--

0:02:29.740,0:02:30.290
KYLE FORD: Yep.

0:02:30.290,0:02:30.699
ERNIE HSIUNG: --in--

0:02:30.699,0:02:30.799
KEVIN MARKS: Right.

0:02:30.800,0:02:30.899
ERNIE HSIUNG: --current--

0:02:30.899,0:02:31.009
KYLE FORD: Yeah.

0:02:31.009,0:02:34.880
ERNIE HSIUNG: --social network containers, and we're tryin' to kind of offer this new kind of option for open social

0:02:34.910,0:02:37.110
developers, saying, like, "Well, here's-- here's another way that"--

0:02:37.110,0:02:37.440
KYLE FORD: Yeah.

0:02:37.440,0:02:39.839
ERNIE HSIUNG: --"your-- your applications can really make an impact for"--

0:02:39.839,0:02:40.160
KYLE FORD: Yeah.

0:02:40.160,0:02:40.790
ERNIE HSIUNG: --"social networks on Ning."

0:02:40.789,0:02:44.910
KYLE FORD: And I-- I think one of the-- the cool things about it-- from a distribution standpoint is that, you know,

0:02:44.910,0:02:49.989
when someone adds a profile app-- the relationship between the developer and the individual is-- is-- is one to one.

0:02:49.990,0:02:53.729
You know, you're-- you're basically saying, "You know, join this app (?) to see a page. Invite your friends." And

0:02:53.729,0:02:58.540
then-- they all add that s-- individually to their page. So, you know, on network with 100,000 people, you-- you're

0:02:58.539,0:03:02.560
basically trying to go after 100,000 people, whether it's through Virality (PH) or 101 (PH)-- it can be a pain.

0:03:02.559,0:03:08.259
Whereas with the Ning app, if you can lobby the one network creator to install it, we-- can-- can blast it across all

0:03:08.259,0:03:12.320
the profile pages. So, that could be with one action, a hundred new-- 100,000 new users for your apps. So, hopefully,

0:03:12.320,0:03:13.720
developers will be excited about that. Yeah.

0:03:13.720,0:03:17.179
KEVIN MARKS: And I think there's a, there's a conceptual overlap here with the brain connect (?) module, where--

0:03:17.179,0:03:17.880
KYLE FORD: Uh-huh (AFFIRM).

0:03:17.880,0:03:19.470
KEVIN MARKS: --again, you're (UNINTEL PHRASE) that embeds on a webpage.

0:03:19.470,0:03:19.919
KYLE FORD: Uh-huh (AFFIRM).

0:03:19.919,0:03:24.119
KEVIN MARKS: And I (?) suspect developers will see both of these a-- as-- as options to-- to-- to build to--

0:03:24.119,0:03:24.649
KYLE FORD: Yep.

0:03:24.649,0:03:26.480
KEVIN MARKS: --and say, "I'm doing a (UNINTEL) groups. That would work for"-- (OVERTALK)

0:03:26.479,0:03:26.750
KEVIN MARKS: --"Ning app."

0:03:26.750,0:03:26.960
KYLE FORD: Yep.

0:03:26.960,0:03:27.300
ERNIE HSIUNG: Right, right, right.

0:03:27.300,0:03:30.919
KEVIN MARKS: So, with this-- encouraging developers to do that, I suspect, we'll see some-- (OVERTALK)

0:03:30.919,0:03:35.080
KYLE FORD: I think. An-- an-- and we were just saying that, too, in fact, at th-- some of the talks yesterday, where--

0:03:35.080,0:03:39.479
a lot of the (UNINTEL) developers were interested in-- in skinning their apps, because they're gonna be on a-- a lot

0:03:39.479,0:03:39.860
more, you know-- (OVERTALK)

0:03:39.860,0:03:43.160
KYLE FORD: --disparate containers, different looks, and that absolutely applies to us, too. So, I-- I thi-- I think

0:03:43.160,0:03:44.290
there's gonna be a lot of overlap, yeah.

0:03:44.289,0:03:44.839
ERNIE HSIUNG: Uh-huh (AFFIRM).

0:03:44.839,0:03:46.970
KEVIN MARKS: A-- are you guys working on the skinning standard with--

0:03:46.970,0:03:48.169
KYLE FORD: We-- (OVERTALK)

0:03:48.169,0:03:52.319
KYLE FORD: --we-- I mean, yeah, we-- we're definitely encouraging it. You know, more than encouraging. St-- not

0:03:52.319,0:03:55.709
necessarily mandating, but strongly encouraging-- people to take advantage. 'Cause I mean, we-- we've seen ne--

0:03:55.740,0:03:59.740
network (?) creator response, even so far in our Beta period has been, you know, wha-- wha-- you know, they're head

0:03:59.740,0:04:03.469
over heels in love with apps that seamlessly blend in and it looks great. It doesn't look like it's a widget just

0:04:03.470,0:04:05.020
dropped on the page. The more seamless--

0:04:05.020,0:04:05.020
KEVIN MARKS: Right.

0:04:05.020,0:04:06.959
KYLE FORD: --it is, the more-- apt they are to install it.

0:04:06.959,0:04:07.949
KEVIN MARKS: Of course, you allowed quite a bit of--

0:04:07.949,0:04:08.520
KYLE FORD: Uh-huh (AFFIRM).

0:04:08.520,0:04:09.099
KEVIN MARKS: --customization-- (OVERTALK)

0:04:09.100,0:04:10.430
KYLE FORD: --each network is its own-- (OVERTALK)

0:04:10.429,0:04:10.660
KYLE FORD: Exactly--

0:04:10.660,0:04:10.889
KEVIN MARKS: Yeah.

0:04:10.889,0:04:11.119
KYLE FORD: --yeah. Exactly.

0:04:11.119,0:04:12.639
KEVIN MARKS: Interesting.

0:04:12.639,0:04:13.729
KYLE FORD: Yeah.

0:04:13.729,0:04:16.619
KEVIN MARKS: So, (UNINTEL) and so that, yeah, tha-- that-- that bodes well for the spec and th-- helping (?) drive

0:04:16.619,0:04:16.750
it--

0:04:16.750,0:04:17.279
KYLE FORD: Uh-huh (AFFIRM).

0:04:17.279,0:04:17.809
KEVIN MARKS: --and-- (OVERTALK)

0:04:17.809,0:04:18.339
KYLE FORD: Yeah, for sure.

0:04:18.399,0:04:23.049
KEVIN MARKS: Are there, are there particular apps that-- that-- that you've been surprised by or excited by--

0:04:23.049,0:04:23.409
(OVERTALK)

0:04:23.409,0:04:25.229
KYLE FORD: Uh-huh (AFFIRM). Yeah.

0:04:25.229,0:04:26.919
ERNIE HSIUNG: I had a couple-- (OVERTALK)

0:04:26.919,0:04:30.669
ERNIE HSIUNG: Slingset (PH) actually built one-- built an application-- for-- called New Share (PH), and it's

0:04:30.669,0:04:37.129
basically, it actually makes perfect sense, wha-- used within the context of a social networ-- social network on Ning,

0:04:37.129,0:04:42.819
because it kind of has a Digg (PH) style-- interface and functionality, where users can submit their own links and

0:04:42.849,0:04:50.119
people can vote it up or vote it down. Kind of makes perfect sense within the context of a social network. Other--

0:04:50.119,0:04:56.189
other applications are doing surprisingly well-- like-- Huddle (PH) is really seeing a-- an application for

0:04:56.249,0:05:02.259
collaboration software, which makes perfect sense within the confines of a social network on Ning. A couple of

0:05:02.259,0:05:02.309
(UNINTEL)--

0:05:02.309,0:05:06.749
KYLE FORD: Yeah, I was gonna say, I-- I mean, Youstream (PH) has done-- you know, I mean, certainly, to date, people

0:05:06.749,0:05:10.579
can grab Youstream embeddables (PH) and paste them. But I think what's interesting about our (UNINTEL) with Youstream

0:05:10.579,0:05:14.949
is that, you know, you'll have a homepage placement which could be, like, you'll-- let's say (UNINTEL) 50 Cent (?),

0:05:14.949,0:05:18.419
for example, is one of our network creators. They (UNINTEL) have a-- the fi-- the official 50 Cent channel on the

0:05:18.419,0:05:22.889
homepage-- stream with Youstream with chat and everything. But then to just install all the profile pages, those also

0:05:22.889,0:05:27.329
get their own separate view. So, each member could then potentially-- add their own Youstream channel, and kind of

0:05:27.329,0:05:30.019
talk back, that way. So, all the members get their own channels, and the-- (OVERTALK)

0:05:30.019,0:05:30.119
KEVIN MARKS: Oh, that's interesting--

0:05:30.119,0:05:31.919
KYLE FORD: --which is kind of interesting implementation, I think, so--

0:05:31.919,0:05:34.569
ERNIE HSIUNG: And mar-- marketplace application, such as Heartfly (PH). So--

0:05:34.569,0:05:35.089
KYLE FORD: Uh-huh (AFFIRM).

0:05:35.089,0:05:39.339
ERNIE HSIUNG: --an Ecommerce (PH)-- an Ecommerce open social application suddenly means a lot more when you're, when

0:05:39.339,0:05:44.739
it's put in the context of a social network, because it's-- it-- it becomes a sho-- it's a place o-- it becomes a

0:05:44.799,0:05:46.019
place where people can actually buy things--

0:05:46.019,0:05:47.099
KYLE FORD: Uh-huh (AFFIRM).

0:05:47.099,0:05:52.440
ERNIE HSIUNG: --specifically geared towards the social network. And it-- it makes more sense-- in my personal opinion,

0:05:52.439,0:05:56.259
than when you put it just on a profile-- page of-- of a social networking (UNINTEL).

0:05:56.259,0:05:56.809
KYLE FORD: Yeah.

0:05:56.809,0:06:00.669
KEVIN MARKS: I see. So, it ends up being a-- a-- a conversation the group is having with itself-- (OVERTALK)

0:06:00.669,0:06:02.469
KEVIN MARKS: --around the things they're buying?

0:06:02.469,0:06:03.219
ERNIE HSIUNG: Yes.

0:06:03.219,0:06:04.459
KYLE FORD: Ye-- yeah, absolutely.

0:06:04.469,0:06:05.720
KEVIN MARKS: So, if you've got a sports group, it'll be, "Well, here's the-- the right place"-- (OVERTALK)

0:06:05.719,0:06:06.399
ERNIE HSIUNG: --wanna buy sports (?) stuff--

0:06:06.399,0:06:06.689
KYLE FORD: Right. (OVERTALK)

0:06:06.689,0:06:07.729
ERNIE HSIUNG: --here you go. Yeah, absolutely.

0:06:07.729,0:06:08.109
KYLE FORD: Exactly. (OVERTALK)

0:06:08.109,0:06:09.279
KEVIN MARKS: --people recommend stuff within the-- the group--

0:06:09.279,0:06:09.669
KYLE FORD: Yep.

0:06:09.669,0:06:10.789
KEVIN MARKS: --yeah. That-- that makes a lot of sense--

0:06:10.789,0:06:14.389
KYLE FORD: Yeah, it's like th-- it's like the niche store model meets the niche social network model, so I think it's

0:06:14.389,0:06:14.709
gonna be--

0:06:14.709,0:06:15.279
KEVIN MARKS: Yeah, that's-- (OVERTALK)

0:06:15.279,0:06:16.189
KYLE FORD: --pretty powerful-- (OVERTALK)

0:06:16.189,0:06:18.109
ERNIE HSIUNG: I mean, it has, it has a lot of-- of huge potential-- (OVERTALK)

0:06:18.109,0:06:18.869
KYLE FORD: Uh-huh (AFFIRM).

0:06:18.869,0:06:23.829
ERNIE HSIUNG --we're kind of hoping that-- that'll kind of be an incentive for developers to-- to kind of seriously

0:06:23.829,0:06:25.759
invest some time de-- deporting (?) their open social applications--

0:06:25.759,0:06:26.159
KYLE FORD: Yeah.

0:06:26.159,0:06:27.100
ERNIE HSIUNG: --for a, for a social--

0:06:27.099,0:06:27.570
KEVIN MARKS: Right. (OVERTALK)

0:06:27.569,0:06:31.239
KEVIN MARKS: Yeah, (UNINTEL) I mean, we've-- we-- we use it for open (UNINTEL PHRASE), for example-- (OVERTALK)

0:06:31.239,0:06:31.859
KYLE FORD Yeah.

0:06:31.859,0:06:32.829
ERNIE HSIUNG: Yes. (OVERTALK)

0:06:32.829,0:06:33.309
ERNIE HSIUNG: Yes, you do.

0:06:33.309,0:06:34.459
KEVIN MARKS: --our (UNINTEL) obsession (UNINTEL)--

0:06:34.459,0:06:35.289
KYLE FORD: Yeah. (LAUGHTER)

0:06:35.289,0:06:37.499
KEVIN MARKS: We're gonna get-- (UNINTEL)-- (OVERTALK)

0:06:37.499,0:06:38.829
ERNIE HSIUNG: --yeah, it gets a little meta, so.

0:06:38.829,0:06:43.329
KEVIN MARKS: So-- what stuff have-- what stuff have you found at I/O? What kind of inquiries have you been getting

0:06:43.329,0:06:43.720
here?

0:06:43.719,0:06:48.959
ERNIE HSIUNG: What kind of inquiries? Just al-- well, we've get-- we've got a lot of range of-- different developers.

0:06:48.959,0:06:55.179
So, a lot of, a lot of people that are built a-- building thin-- on different things, unrelated to open social, are

0:06:55.179,0:06:57.029
kind of coming and learning about Ning for the first time.

0:06:57.029,0:06:57.139
KYLE FORD Yeah. (OVERTALK)

0:06:57.139,0:06:58.719
ERNIE HSIUNG: --we're-- we're just recently--(OVERTALK)

0:06:58.799,0:06:59.519
ERNIE HSIUNG: --getting a big PR push.

0:06:59.519,0:06:59.669
KYLE FORD: Uh-huh (AFFIRM).

0:06:59.669,0:07:04.849
ERNIE HSIUNG: So-- so we're kind of-- first off, getting our name out there helps a lot, especially in terms of the

0:07:04.879,0:07:11.139
brand identity, but also in terms of talking about open-- having developers build open social features for us. On an

0:07:11.139,0:07:17.139
open social level, I think we're definitely trying to get our name out there. Definitely, the-- the-- the High Five

0:07:17.139,0:07:25.619
(PH) and-- High Five and Orchid (PH) are definitely kind of the go-to-- open social containers (?). And for good

0:07:25.619,0:07:32.109
reason, because they definitely are at the top of the game, in terms of ver-- like being the '09 (?) Sandbox for open

0:07:32.109,0:07:32.349
social.

0:07:32.349,0:07:33.329
KYLE FORD: Uh-huh (AFFIRM).

0:07:33.329,0:07:38.269
ERNIE HSIUNG: We also, we're also-- one of the reasons why we're here is to also kind of-- remind developers that

0:07:38.269,0:07:46.239
there's other kind of containers out there. Not necessarily just for the-- just for the profile, but expanding on the

0:07:46.239,0:07:46.479
profile--

0:07:46.479,0:07:47.199
KYLE FORD: Yeah.

0:07:47.199,0:07:52.779
ERNIE HSIUNG: --page. And maybe kind of putting something in their heads, that, like, well, if-- e-- may-- if-- if

0:07:52.989,0:08:00.139
what you're building is more appropriate for a, kind of a group setting, a-- a-- to-- for it to be on the main

0:08:00.139,0:08:02.249
(UNINTEL) social network, maybe you should think about building for us. And that would be awesome--

0:08:02.249,0:08:02.719
KYLE FORD: Uh-huh (AFFIRM).

0:08:02.719,0:08:03.099
ERNIE HSIUNG: --and-- and that way--

0:08:03.099,0:08:03.099
KEVIN MARKS: Right.

0:08:03.099,0:08:09.709
ERNIE HSIUNG: --we win (?), of course, in that you get-- you get-- we get s-- awesome feature, but you guys win

0:08:09.829,0:08:14.359
because all these networks have the opportunity to add your application--

0:08:14.359,0:08:15.229
KEVIN MARKS: Yeah.

0:08:15.229,0:08:16.259
ERNIE HSIUNG: --and get brand exposure and--

0:08:16.259,0:08:21.499
KEVIN MARKS: Right. (UNINTEL) something I was saying in th-- (UNINTEL) yesterday, was that trying-- a lot of these

0:08:21.499,0:08:23.939
things grow very organically, and you're not quite sure whether the apps going to take off--(OVERTALK)

0:08:23.939,0:08:24.299
KYLE FORD: Yep--

0:08:24.299,0:08:24.659
ERNIE HSIUNG: Right.

0:08:24.659,0:08:27.419
KEVIN MARKS: --stories from the app developers.

0:08:27.419,0:08:28.009
ERNIE HSIUNG: Right.

0:08:28.649,0:08:31.189
KEVIN MARKS: And I think you provide-- (UNINTEL PHRASE) into a new place, and-- (OVERTALK)

0:08:31.189,0:08:31.529
KYLE FORD: Yep.

0:08:31.539,0:08:33.669
KEVIN MARKS: --it that way.

0:08:33.669,0:08:33.669
ERNIE HSIUNG: Yeah. That's-- (OVERTALK)

0:08:33.669,0:08:33.669
KYLE FORD: Yeah.

0:08:33.669,0:08:33.839
ERNIE HSIUNG: --the hope, so--

0:08:33.839,0:08:39.140
KYLE FORD: Yeah. So, we'll see. And-- and for the network creators, too, obviously, you know, there have been, wha-- a

0:08:39.140,0:08:43.820
lot of people we've targeted or gone after-- to ge-- you know, to get these Ning apps in for launch a-- you know, have

0:08:43.820,0:08:48.250
been based on feature requests we hear from network creators. You know, Ning offers a-- you know, ten or 15 features,

0:08:48.250,0:08:52.940
but we've heard, time and time again, "You know, I'd love to be able to-- do news-- new-- new style ranking. I'd love

0:08:52.940,0:08:57.000
to do b-- build (UNINTEL) Ecommerce or live video streaming." Things that, you know, we may eventually get to, but

0:08:57.039,0:09:01.130
it's certainly not on our short-term road map. And so now, to be able to kind of patch these holes with these, you

0:09:01.130,0:09:01.810
know, great--

0:09:01.809,0:09:01.890
KEVIN MARKS Right.

0:09:01.890,0:09:03.240
KYLE FORD: --third party offerings is gonna be great-- (OVERTALK)

0:09:03.239,0:09:03.450
KYLE FORD: --yeah.

0:09:03.450,0:09:04.330
KEVIN MARKS: --that was always part of the goal of-- (OVERTALK)

0:09:04.330,0:09:04.590
KYLE FORD: Yeah.

0:09:04.590,0:09:06.130
KEVIN MARKS: --social, is the--

0:09:06.130,0:09:06.390
KYLE FORD: Yeah.

0:09:06.390,0:09:07.950
KEVIN MARKS: --the-- the social networks get new features--

0:09:07.950,0:09:08.070
KYLE FORD: Exactly-- (OVERTALK)

0:09:08.070,0:09:08.070
KEVIN MARKS: --build themselves--

0:09:08.070,0:09:08.070
KYLE FORD: Yep.

0:09:08.070,0:09:10.779
KEVIN MARKS: --and the developers get a platform (UNINTEL) instead of users-- (OVERTALK)

0:09:10.780,0:09:11.640
KYLE FORD: Yeah, so.

0:09:11.640,0:09:13.469
KEVIN MARKS: --up to, without having to go and (UNINTEL)--

0:09:13.470,0:09:13.850
KYLE FORD: Exactly. (OVERTALK)

0:09:13.850,0:09:13.920
KYLE FORD: Yeah.

0:09:13.910,0:09:15.980
KEVIN MARKS: --mutual benefit going on there. And (UNINTEL PHRASE) saying--

0:09:15.979,0:09:16.760
KYLE FORD: Yeah.

0:09:16.770,0:09:17.770
KEVIN MARKS: --social network (UNINTEL) got more interesting.

0:09:17.770,0:09:18.520
KYLE FORD: Right, exactly.

0:09:18.520,0:09:18.650
ERNIE HSIUNG: So, we're--

0:09:18.650,0:09:18.750
KYLE FORD: Yeah.

0:09:18.750,0:09:20.349
ERNIE HSIUNG: --going from 15 to 100 features, and that's-- that's--

0:09:20.350,0:09:20.599
KYLE FORD: Yeah. (LAUGHTER)

0:09:20.600,0:09:21.240
ERNIE HSIUNG: --gonna get exciting--

0:09:21.239,0:09:22.160
KYLE FORD: It will be.

0:09:22.160,0:09:22.559
ERNIE HSIUNG: --and scary.

0:09:22.559,0:09:22.559
KEVIN MARKS: Oh, wow.

0:09:22.559,0:09:22.559
KYLE FORD: Yeah.

0:09:22.559,0:09:23.260
ERNIE HSIUNG: Kind of-- (OVERTALK)

0:09:23.260,0:09:27.190
ERNIE HSIUNG: --and it-- it's-- so-- so-- so we'll see (UNINTEL) all happens, and this is all, it's all completely new

0:09:27.190,0:09:27.299
and--

0:09:27.299,0:09:27.560
KYLE FORD: Yeah.

0:09:27.559,0:09:28.920
ERNIE HSIUNG: --we're-- we're excited. We're very excited. S--

KEVIN MARKS: Excellent.
