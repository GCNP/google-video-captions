00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,701
Kitagawa: Hi, my name's
Justin Kitagawa,

2
00:00:01,701 --> 00:00:04,267
and I'm a senior product manager
at GoGrid.

3
00:00:04,267 --> 00:00:06,267
I was also
the lead developer

4
00:00:06,267 --> 00:00:09,934
that helped build
our application "GoGrid."

5
00:00:09,934 --> 00:00:11,567
I'm here today
to show you our application,

6
00:00:11,567 --> 00:00:13,801
and we used GWT
to build it.

7
00:00:13,801 --> 00:00:16,000
"GoGrid" is our
award-winning control panel.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,567
Using "GoGrid,"
you can create,

9
00:00:17,567 --> 00:00:20,234
deploy, and destroy
your infrastructure on demand.

10
00:00:20,234 --> 00:00:22,534
You're able to add
load balancers,

11
00:00:22,534 --> 00:00:26,000
virtual servers, and storage
easily and quickly

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,234
with just a mouse.

13
00:00:29,234 --> 00:00:32,734
Our load balancers are F5
hardware-based load balancers.

14
00:00:32,734 --> 00:00:34,801
You can specify
a virtual IP,

15
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:38,133
which will get multiplexed out
to real IPs.

16
00:00:38,133 --> 00:00:41,334
Our virtual servers
support numerous OSs:

17
00:00:41,334 --> 00:00:45,300
CentOS, Red Hat,
Windows 2003 and 2008.

18
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,367
And coming soon
will be Ubuntu and Debian.

19
00:00:49,367 --> 00:00:52,133
And our cloud storage
is an infinitely-scalable,

20
00:00:52,133 --> 00:00:55,334
mountable, um,
disc offering,

21
00:00:55,334 --> 00:00:59,234
so that you can store your data
permanently and reliably.

22
00:00:59,234 --> 00:01:01,634
We implemented on-hovers
for the various objects,

23
00:01:01,634 --> 00:01:03,868
so that you can see
detailed information

24
00:01:03,868 --> 00:01:06,033
for each
of the objects.

25
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:08,067
We've also implemented
context menus,

26
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:10,167
so that with
a right mouse click,

27
00:01:10,167 --> 00:01:12,667
you're able
to get to pertinent actions

28
00:01:12,667 --> 00:01:14,934
for the various objects.

29
00:01:14,934 --> 00:01:17,267
Deleting objects
is just as easy

30
00:01:17,267 --> 00:01:19,033
as creating objects.

31
00:01:19,033 --> 00:01:21,534
And with a couple clicks,

32
00:01:21,534 --> 00:01:24,567
you're able
to destroy your server.

33
00:01:24,567 --> 00:01:26,601
We used GWT
to build our AJAX front end.

34
00:01:26,601 --> 00:01:30,000
We knew that we were going
to be redefining and, uh,

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,834
data center automation
with "GoGrid,"

36
00:01:31,834 --> 00:01:33,133
and we wanted
to make sure

37
00:01:33,133 --> 00:01:36,133
that we had a state-of-the-art
control panel to do so.

38
00:01:36,133 --> 00:01:40,200
Inspired by state-of-the-art
AJAX applications,

39
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,567
we wanted to make sure that
we were on the cutting edge.

40
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:44,634
We wanted to build
a thick client

41
00:01:44,634 --> 00:01:47,868
inside the browser.

42
00:01:47,868 --> 00:01:50,367
GWT has allowed us
to create

43
00:01:50,367 --> 00:01:51,934
many of our own
custom widgets,

44
00:01:51,934 --> 00:01:56,367
so that we are able to get
our own unique look and feel.

45
00:01:56,367 --> 00:01:59,434
But we've also been able
to leverage and utilize,

46
00:01:59,434 --> 00:02:03,968
um, many of the existing
UI constructs

47
00:02:03,968 --> 00:02:07,834
such as, um,
the various panels,

48
00:02:07,834 --> 00:02:12,067
suggests, tree widgets,
so on and so forth.

49
00:02:12,067 --> 00:02:13,501
One thing that's great
about GWT

50
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:15,067
is it's open source.

51
00:02:15,067 --> 00:02:18,067
So if a widget doesn't look
or feel or act

52
00:02:18,067 --> 00:02:19,501
the way
that we want it to,

53
00:02:19,501 --> 00:02:22,033
we're able to essentially
just copy it and tweak it

54
00:02:22,033 --> 00:02:23,534
as we need it to.

55
00:02:23,534 --> 00:02:25,801
And so we've done that
in numerous occasions as well.

56
00:02:25,801 --> 00:02:27,234
It's very powerful,

57
00:02:27,234 --> 00:02:30,033
and it's increased
our productivity greatly.

58
00:02:30,033 --> 00:02:33,033
Um, essentially,
it's build once,

59
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:34,634
and then you can
deploy it anywhere.

60
00:02:34,634 --> 00:02:36,334
It'll just work
in the various browsers.

61
00:02:36,334 --> 00:02:39,534
And so that's really facilitated
our testing strategies,

62
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:42,968
and, um, really opened up
development as well.

63
00:02:42,968 --> 00:02:45,234
We're able to build
a very complex,

64
00:02:45,234 --> 00:02:48,834
rich UI application
quickly and easily.
