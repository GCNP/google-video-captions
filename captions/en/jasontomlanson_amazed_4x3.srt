Tomlinson: Hi, my name's
Jason Tomlinson.

2
00:00:02,234 --> 00:00:04,334
I'm an engineering manager
at Hands-On Mobile.

3
00:00:04,334 --> 00:00:05,767
I'm here today
to talk to you

4
00:00:05,767 --> 00:00:07,300
about an Android application
I've written

5
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,534
which uses the accelerometer
feature of the platform.

6
00:00:09,534 --> 00:00:11,467
The game is called "Amazed."

7
00:00:11,467 --> 00:00:12,734
The whole idea of the game

8
00:00:12,734 --> 00:00:14,801
is to navigate a marble
through the maze

9
00:00:14,801 --> 00:00:17,167
by tilting the device
in various directions.

10
00:00:17,167 --> 00:00:18,868
Whatever direction
you tilt the device,

11
00:00:18,868 --> 00:00:20,601
the marble will follow
the same path.

12
00:00:20,601 --> 00:00:22,968
You have to try
and navigate the marble

13
00:00:22,968 --> 00:00:24,300
to the light blue area,

14
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,067
which will then
take you to the next level.

15
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:28,834
As you progress through
the ten levels of the game,

16
00:00:28,834 --> 00:00:30,701
each level gets
progressively harder,

17
00:00:30,701 --> 00:00:32,534
until you
get to Level Ten

18
00:00:32,534 --> 00:00:34,868
which is almost impossible.

19
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,234
So that's the game.

20
00:00:36,234 --> 00:00:37,501
You can find it
open-sourced

21
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:38,834
on the Apps for Android
project.

22
00:00:38,834 --> 00:00:40,968
While it is only
a simple technical demo,

23
00:00:40,968 --> 00:00:43,200
I built it to play around
with the accelerometer feature

24
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,501
of the Android platform.

25
00:00:44,501 --> 00:00:46,133
It was born from the fact

26
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:48,467
that I was working
on "Guitar Hero: World Tour"

27
00:00:48,467 --> 00:00:50,334
which we're bringing
to the Android platform,

28
00:00:50,334 --> 00:00:52,400
fully leveraging
all the specific features

29
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,667
including multiplayer
battle mode,

30
00:00:54,667 --> 00:00:56,434
so you and your friends
can play against each other

31
00:00:56,434 --> 00:00:57,801
in real time.
