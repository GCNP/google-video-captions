00:00:04,033 --> 00:00:05,400
Hi, I'm Mano.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,734
I'm gonna be speaking
with Keith and Jeff

3
00:00:07,734 --> 00:00:10,400
about building
scalable GeoWeb applications

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,067
at Google I/O.

5
00:00:12,067 --> 00:00:14,734
Over the last five years,
there's been an explosion

6
00:00:14,734 --> 00:00:17,434
of Web-based
geographic applications,

7
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,567
which we often call the GeoWeb.

8
00:00:19,567 --> 00:00:22,734
The growth of these applications
has been driven by such tools

9
00:00:22,734 --> 00:00:25,234
as Google Maps API
and Google Earth.

10
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:27,234
These tools take care of the
front end of the deployment--

11
00:00:27,234 --> 00:00:30,067
the complex job of putting
the right map tiles

12
00:00:30,067 --> 00:00:31,567
in front of the right people.

13
00:00:31,567 --> 00:00:36,734
However, developers
who have a rich spatial data set

14
00:00:36,734 --> 00:00:40,567
have to build the back ends for
these applications themselves.

15
00:00:40,567 --> 00:00:42,067
When these applications
scale up

16
00:00:42,067 --> 00:00:44,234
with tons of data
and lots of users,

17
00:00:44,234 --> 00:00:47,234
Geo Developers have to become
Web server architects,

18
00:00:47,234 --> 00:00:48,901
sharding their databases,

19
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:50,400
balancing the loads
between servers,

20
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,400
and spending a fair amount
of money, and lots of time,

21
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,234
just to have their applications
continue to run.

22
00:00:56,234 --> 00:00:57,901
In this talk, we'll talk about

23
00:00:57,901 --> 00:00:59,901
what are the problems
of scalability,

24
00:00:59,901 --> 00:01:01,234
what are some
of the approaches,

25
00:01:01,234 --> 00:01:04,067
and what Google offers
in a way of data hosting

26
00:01:04,067 --> 00:01:06,234
that is useful
for spatial data.

27
00:01:06,234 --> 00:01:08,634
Specifically,
we'll talk about Google Base,

28
00:01:08,634 --> 00:01:09,868
Google App Engine,

29
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:12,734
and the really exciting
new Google Maps data API,

30
00:01:12,734 --> 00:01:16,567
which uses the standard
Google Data API set

31
00:01:16,567 --> 00:01:18,133
based on Atom Pub.

32
00:01:18,133 --> 00:01:20,400
So here's the basic code.

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,767
This is Atom Pub.

34
00:01:21,767 --> 00:01:25,234
Anybody who's familiar with it
will recognize this.

35
00:01:25,234 --> 00:01:27,400
This is posting an entry

36
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,234
to edit a link
of an existing feature

37
00:01:30,234 --> 00:01:32,067
in Google Maps.

38
00:01:32,067 --> 00:01:34,400
You'll see here
you've got your atom entry.

39
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,234
You've got title and content.

40
00:01:36,234 --> 00:01:38,400
These are all familiar to you
if you've used Atom Pub

41
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,734
or any of the Google Data APIs
which are based on Atom Pub.

42
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:43,067
Then you'll see "Placemark,"

43
00:01:43,067 --> 00:01:46,901
and that's
in the KML name space.

44
00:01:46,901 --> 00:01:48,901
Maps Data API reuses KML.

45
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:50,234
It's really exciting.

46
00:01:50,234 --> 00:01:52,734
A lot of people
have been talking about this.

47
00:01:52,734 --> 00:01:55,567
How do you integrate,
you know, restful applications

48
00:01:55,567 --> 00:01:57,734
with KML?

49
00:01:57,734 --> 00:01:59,300
And here we are.

50
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,234
"Description, style, point"--

51
00:02:02,234 --> 00:02:04,567
These are just standard KML.

52
00:02:04,567 --> 00:02:06,467
You're just posting
a Placemark.

53
00:02:06,467 --> 00:02:08,367
And that's it.
That's all you have to do.

54
00:02:08,367 --> 00:02:11,901
So we're gonna go over this
and a lot more during the talk,

55
00:02:11,901 --> 00:02:13,400
and I really look forward
to seeing you.

56
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,000
Hope you can make it.
