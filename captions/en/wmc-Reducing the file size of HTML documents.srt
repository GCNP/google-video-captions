1
00:00:06,033 --> 00:00:07,434
Meiert: Hi, my name is Jens.

2
00:00:07,434 --> 00:00:09,267
At Google,
I'm the webmaster responsible

3
00:00:09,267 --> 00:00:12,133
for quality assurance
and education outreach.

4
00:00:12,133 --> 00:00:14,133
Khaw: Hi, my name is Kevin.

5
00:00:14,133 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm a webmaster,
and I build fun tools

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,968
for the Webmaster team
at Google.

7
00:00:17,968 --> 00:00:19,400
Meiert: Without HTML,
we wouldn't have

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,501
the Web we have today.

9
00:00:20,501 --> 00:00:22,801
There are billions of documents
out there

10
00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:25,601
providing information
and services of all sorts.

11
00:00:25,601 --> 00:00:29,167
The Webmaster team alone
maintains hundreds of thousands

12
00:00:29,167 --> 00:00:31,100
of HTML documents.

13
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,734
Khaw: Writing HTML is easy,

14
00:00:32,734 --> 00:00:36,133
but writing maintainable,
fast, and accessible HTML

15
00:00:36,133 --> 00:00:37,934
can be rather challenging.

16
00:00:37,934 --> 00:00:40,267
There's a feature in HTML
that we really like.

17
00:00:40,267 --> 00:00:42,100
Remember, not XHTML.

18
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,334
HTML allows you
to leave out certain tags.

19
00:00:46,334 --> 00:00:48,467
Meiert: That means you don't
have to close

20
00:00:48,467 --> 00:00:49,968
your paragraph
and other elements.

21
00:00:49,968 --> 00:00:53,634
You can entirely skip
your HTML head and body text,

22
00:00:53,634 --> 00:00:57,100
and that's something authors do
with tbody element anyways.

23
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,901
These texts
are entirely optional.

24
00:00:58,901 --> 00:01:01,334
And the HTML
will still be valid.

25
00:01:01,334 --> 00:01:03,534
Khaw: It takes a while
to get used to this technique.

26
00:01:03,534 --> 00:01:05,434
But leaving out optional texts

27
00:01:05,434 --> 00:01:07,033
will make your pages
a lot smaller

28
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:09,234
and easier to understand.

29
00:01:09,234 --> 00:01:12,000
Meiert: Maybe one thing
we especially like about this

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,901
is that we can keep things
simple.

31
00:01:13,901 --> 00:01:16,300
