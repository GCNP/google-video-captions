1
00:00:07,901 --> 00:00:09,400
man: Where are we?

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,000
second man: This is
the last stage of the journey.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,167
We finally made it.
This is it.

4
00:00:12,167 --> 00:00:13,701
man: How do we know
this is the place?

5
00:00:13,701 --> 00:00:15,901
second man: This is where
he writes his code, I'm sure.

6
00:00:15,901 --> 00:00:17,400
It's where the emails
have been coming from.

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,667
man: are you sure?
second man: Yeah.

8
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:20,434
We've been tracking
his IP address right here.

9
00:00:20,434 --> 00:00:23,934
This has gotta be the building
where the genius lives.

10
00:00:23,934 --> 00:00:25,534
man: This is private property.
I don't think we should be--

11
00:00:25,534 --> 00:00:26,634
Wait, where are you going?!

12
00:00:26,634 --> 00:00:27,734
second man:
No one's ever seen him.

13
00:00:27,734 --> 00:00:28,968
man: We can't go in there.

14
00:00:28,968 --> 00:00:30,033
second man: We've gotta find
him--come here.

15
00:00:30,033 --> 00:00:31,734
Oh, my God! Look at this.
man: Wow.

16
00:00:31,734 --> 00:00:32,901
second man: I don't know if
we're supposed to be--

17
00:00:32,901 --> 00:00:35,234
man: This is really freaky.

18
00:00:35,234 --> 00:00:37,000
second man: No, come on.
Down here.

19
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,067
You know, he works alone.
I'm sure of that.

20
00:00:39,067 --> 00:00:41,567
man: Wait, so who reviews
his code?

21
00:00:41,567 --> 00:00:42,934
second man:
Nobody reviews his code.

22
00:00:42,934 --> 00:00:44,200
What do you think, we're worthy?
He's a genius.

23
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,567
I mean,
he's all over the internet.

24
00:00:45,567 --> 00:00:47,200
man: But he works
with a whole team.

25
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,067
I mean, what if he gets stuck
down a rat hole?

26
00:00:49,067 --> 00:00:51,033
second man:
You think he wants feedback?

27
00:00:51,033 --> 00:00:53,400
I mean, that's ridiculous.
Who's gonna give him feedback?

28
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,501
You know what happened
to the last guy

29
00:00:54,501 --> 00:00:55,667
who gave him feedback?

30
00:00:55,667 --> 00:00:57,367
Do you remember what happened?

31
00:00:57,367 --> 00:00:59,567
Wait, wait.
This could be it.

32
00:00:59,567 --> 00:01:02,000
No, wait.
I hear something in here.

33
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,367
I hear something.

34
00:01:03,367 --> 00:01:05,234
We're gonna go in.
Are you ready?

35
00:01:05,234 --> 00:01:06,501
Are you ready?
You gonna come with me?

36
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:07,501
second man: We need to go.
man: You gonna go first?

37
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:08,634
All right, I'm going in.
Ready?

38
00:01:08,634 --> 00:01:10,234
Let's go.

39
00:01:10,234 --> 00:01:11,701
Oh, my God!
genius: Who are you?

40
00:01:11,701 --> 00:01:13,868
man: Are you the genius?
What are you working on?

41
00:01:13,868 --> 00:01:15,100
>> He's writing code,
I'll bet.

42
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,200
genius: Hey, no, stop.
Don't look at that!

43
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,267
Get out of here!
