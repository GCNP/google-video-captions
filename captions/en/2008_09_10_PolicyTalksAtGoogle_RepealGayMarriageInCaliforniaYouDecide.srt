1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,434
LaJeunesse: GOOD AFTERNOON
AND THANKS TO EVERYONE

2
00:00:03,434 --> 00:00:05,267
FOR BEING HERE.

3
00:00:05,267 --> 00:00:06,801
MY NAME IS ROSS LAJEUNESSE,

4
00:00:06,801 --> 00:00:09,300
AND I AM HEAD OF STATE POLICY
FOR THE WESTERN U.S.

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,267
HERE AT GOOGLE.

6
00:00:11,267 --> 00:00:13,234
TODAY'S PANEL
IS ON PROPOSITION 8,

7
00:00:13,234 --> 00:00:15,367
WHICH I'M SURE
ALL OF YOU KNOW

8
00:00:15,367 --> 00:00:18,501
IS THE BALLOT INITIATIVE

9
00:00:18,501 --> 00:00:20,567
GOING BEFORE VOTERS
THIS NOVEMBER

10
00:00:20,567 --> 00:00:23,400
WHICH WOULD AMEND
THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,767
TO PROHIBIT
SAME-SEX MARRIAGE

12
00:00:25,767 --> 00:00:27,300
HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

13
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,467
[man speaking indistinctly]

14
00:00:29,467 --> 00:00:31,534
LaJeunesse: THAT RAISES
A GOOD POINT.

15
00:00:31,534 --> 00:00:35,501
TODAY'S PANEL IS NOT BALANCED.

16
00:00:35,501 --> 00:00:38,667
AND BY THAT I HAVE NO COMMENT
ON THE MENTAL FACULTIES

17
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:40,400
OF OUR THREE PANELISTS.

18
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,734
I'M MERELY
STATING THAT

19
00:00:42,734 --> 00:00:45,400
WE DO NOT HAVE OPPONENTS
AND PROPONENTS OF PROP 8

20
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,534
ON TODAY'S PANEL.

21
00:00:48,534 --> 00:00:50,300
THE REASON FOR THAT
IS TODAY'S PANEL

22
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,534
IS HAPPENING
THROUGH THE HARD WORK

23
00:00:53,534 --> 00:00:56,267
OF THE GAYGLERS GROUP
AND OTHER GOOGLERS

24
00:00:56,267 --> 00:00:59,200
WHO OPPOSE PROPOSITION 8.

25
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,701
THE PUBLIC POLICY GROUP
IS SUPPORTING THOSE EFFORTS

26
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:04,267
AND IS HELPING
TO HOST THE PANEL,

27
00:01:04,267 --> 00:01:06,834
AND WE WOULD DO
THE SAME IF WE WERE APPROACHED

28
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:09,968
BY PROPONENTS
OF PROPOSITION 8.

29
00:01:09,968 --> 00:01:12,234
SO I JUST WANTED
TO MAKE THAT CLARIFICATION

30
00:01:12,234 --> 00:01:15,501
BEFORE WE TURNED IT OVER
TO OUR PANELISTS.

31
00:01:15,501 --> 00:01:17,534
WE HAVE A GREAT GROUP

32
00:01:17,534 --> 00:01:19,934
OF PANELISTS
TODAY.

33
00:01:19,934 --> 00:01:23,667
THEY ARE ALL SUPERSTARS.

34
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:28,400
I KNOW EACH OF THEM PERSONALLY
TO SOME DEGREE OR ANOTHER.

35
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,067
AND I'M JUST GONNA DO
A BRIEF INTRODUCTION OF EACH

36
00:01:30,067 --> 00:01:31,834
BEFORE I TURN IT OVER TO THEM.

37
00:01:31,834 --> 00:01:34,567
SO WE'LL HAVE A BRIEF
PRESENTATION FROM EACH PANELIST,

38
00:01:34,567 --> 00:01:39,067
AND THEN I HOPE THAT
WE'LL SPEND A GOOD DEAL OF TIME

39
00:01:39,067 --> 00:01:41,000
ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS
AND HAVING A LIVELY DEBATE

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,934
ABOUT PROPOSITION 8.

41
00:01:43,934 --> 00:01:48,734
TO MY FAR LEFT
IS STEVE SMITH.

42
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:50,801
NOW, STEVE IS A BIT
OF A SACRAMENTO LEGEND.

43
00:01:50,801 --> 00:01:54,501
HE IS A PRINCIPAL AT DEWEY
SQUARE GROUP WHERE HE FOCUSES

44
00:01:54,501 --> 00:01:57,734
ON COMMUNITY ORGANIZING
AND CAMPAIGN MANAGEMENT.

45
00:01:57,734 --> 00:02:01,701
HE WAS THE CAMPAIGN MANAGER
FOR BOTH "NO ON 73"

46
00:02:01,701 --> 00:02:02,801
AND "NO ON 85."

47
00:02:02,801 --> 00:02:03,968
CORRECT?

48
00:02:03,968 --> 00:02:05,801
WHICH WERE THE 2005

49
00:02:05,801 --> 00:02:09,267
AND 2006 BALLOT INITIATIVES
DEALING

50
00:02:09,267 --> 00:02:10,634
WITH PARENTAL NOTIFICATION.

51
00:02:10,634 --> 00:02:13,267
STEVE WON
BOTH THOSE CAMPAIGNS.

52
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:15,100
HE IS NOW
THE CHIEF STRATEGIST

53
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,868
FOR THE "NO ON 8" CAMPAIGN.

54
00:02:17,868 --> 00:02:19,834
IN A PRIOR LIFE,

55
00:02:19,834 --> 00:02:23,801
STEVE WAS SECRETARY OF LABOR
UNDER GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS.

56
00:02:23,801 --> 00:02:28,434
TO STEVE'S RIGHT
IS PATRICK GUERRIERO.

57
00:02:28,434 --> 00:02:31,267
PATRICK IS THE EXECUTIVE
DIRECTOR OF GILL ACTION FUND,

58
00:02:31,267 --> 00:02:35,400
WHICH IS A DENVER-BASED
ADVOCACY GROUP

59
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:41,400
WHICH FOCUSES ON NATIONAL ISSUES
SURROUNDING EQUAL RIGHTS

60
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,601
FOR ALL PEOPLE REGARDLESS
OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION

61
00:02:43,601 --> 00:02:46,367
OR GENDER IDENTITY.

62
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:50,334
IT'S A BIPARTISAN GROUP,
AND IT'S BEEN AROUND--

63
00:02:50,334 --> 00:02:53,267
YOU'VE BEEN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
SINCE 2006, CORRECT?

64
00:02:53,267 --> 00:02:55,901
BEFORE THAT, PATRICK
WAS HEAD

65
00:02:55,901 --> 00:02:57,767
OF THE LOG CABIN REPUBLICANS.

66
00:02:57,767 --> 00:03:00,834
AT THE RIPE
OLD AGE OF 25,

67
00:03:00,834 --> 00:03:02,701
PATRICK WAS ELECTED
TO THE MASSACHUSETTS

68
00:03:02,701 --> 00:03:04,167
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

69
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:06,234
BACK IN 1993.

70
00:03:06,234 --> 00:03:07,767
HE SERVED THREE TERMS
IN THE HOUSE

71
00:03:07,767 --> 00:03:10,501
BEFORE BEING ELECTED MAYOR
OF HIS HOMETOWN

72
00:03:10,501 --> 00:03:13,567
OF MELROSE, MASSACHUSETTS.

73
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:16,234
AFTER TWO TERMS AS MAYOR,
PATRICK BECAME THE FIRST

74
00:03:16,234 --> 00:03:18,501
OPENLY GAY CANDIDATE
FOR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR

75
00:03:18,501 --> 00:03:21,934
IN THE NATION'S HISTORY
WHEN MASSACHUSETTS GOVERNOR

76
00:03:21,934 --> 00:03:24,801
JANE SWIFT ASKED HIM
TO JOIN HER TICKET.

77
00:03:24,801 --> 00:03:25,968
THAT WAS IN 2002.

78
00:03:25,968 --> 00:03:27,234
Guerriero: RIGHT.

79
00:03:27,234 --> 00:03:32,434
LaJeunesse: TO PATRICK'S RIGHT
IS KATE KENDELL.

80
00:03:32,434 --> 00:03:33,834
AND I AM PERSONALLY
A GREAT FAN OF KATE'S,

81
00:03:33,834 --> 00:03:35,567
EVER SINCE I HEARD HER GIVE
A FANTASTIC SPEECH

82
00:03:35,567 --> 00:03:36,934
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO

83
00:03:36,934 --> 00:03:40,100
WHICH STILL REMAINS
WITH ME TODAY.

84
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:43,667
SHE'S A BRILLIANT ADVOCATE
FOR EQUAL RIGHTS

85
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:46,968
FOR GAY, LESBIAN, BISEXUAL,
AND TRANSGENDERED INDIVIDUALS.

86
00:03:46,968 --> 00:03:49,434
SHE DOES THAT IN HER CAPACITY
AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

87
00:03:49,434 --> 00:03:52,667
OF THE NATIONAL CENTER
FOR LESBIAN RIGHTS

88
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:54,601
BASED IN SAN FRANCISCO.

89
00:03:54,601 --> 00:04:00,367
NCLR ADVOCATES EQUAL PROTECTION
FOR LGBT INDIVIDUALS

90
00:04:00,367 --> 00:04:02,601
THROUGH LITIGATION,
ADVOCACY,

91
00:04:02,601 --> 00:04:04,801
AND PUBLIC EDUCATION.

92
00:04:04,801 --> 00:04:08,501
IN ADDITION, KATE
IS A MUCH SOUGHT AFTER

93
00:04:08,501 --> 00:04:11,801
NATIONAL COMMENTATOR
ON THESE ISSUES.

94
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:13,300
SHE'S APPEARED
IN "THE NEW YORK TIMES,"

95
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,534
"WALL STREET JOURNAL,"
CNN, NPR.

96
00:04:15,534 --> 00:04:18,901
PRETTY MUCH ANY PUBLICATION
ONE CAN THINK OF,

97
00:04:18,901 --> 00:04:20,100
KATE HAS BEEN THERE.

98
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,067
AND KATE IS GOING
TO START US OFF TODAY.

99
00:04:24,067 --> 00:04:25,467
SO I'M GONNA TURN IT
OVER TO YOU.

100
00:04:25,467 --> 00:04:26,968
Kendell: GREAT.
THANK YOU, ROSS.

101
00:04:26,968 --> 00:04:28,968
LaJeunesse: WHY DON'T WE JUST
WELCOME OUR PANELISTS FIRST?

102
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:30,133
THIS IS GREAT.

103
00:04:30,133 --> 00:04:33,367
[applause]

104
00:04:33,367 --> 00:04:36,501
Kendell: AND I JUST WANNA
POINT OUT THAT ROSS

105
00:04:36,501 --> 00:04:38,534
MADE THOSE
VERY GENEROUS INTRODUCTIONS

106
00:04:38,534 --> 00:04:40,901
OF ALL THREE OF US
WITH NOT ONE NOTE.

107
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:42,667
THAT'S...

108
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:44,934
BIG BRAINS,
YOU GOOGLE PEOPLE.

109
00:04:44,934 --> 00:04:45,934
ALL OF YOU.

110
00:04:45,934 --> 00:04:48,534
IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE

111
00:04:48,534 --> 00:04:52,434
AND TO BE TALKING ABOUT
WHAT I THINK IS--

112
00:04:52,434 --> 00:04:54,234
I THINK THE MOST--
WELL, CERTAINLY IT'S THE MOST

113
00:04:54,234 --> 00:04:58,501
IMPORTANT FIGHT THAT
I HAVE FACED AS A MEMBER

114
00:04:58,501 --> 00:05:00,534
OF THE LGBT COMMUNITY.

115
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:03,300
I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE MOST
IMPORTANT PROGRESSIVE FIGHTS

116
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,667
WE'VE EVER FACED
IN THIS NATION.

117
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:09,834
AND I THINK ITS POTENTIAL
TO TURN THE TIDE

118
00:05:09,834 --> 00:05:12,968
ONCE AND FOR ALL AND
TO REALLY CHANGE THE LANDSCAPE

119
00:05:12,968 --> 00:05:17,534
FOR EVERYONE IN THIS COUNTRY
REGARDLESS OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION

120
00:05:17,534 --> 00:05:19,901
IS REALLY ENORMOUS,
AND I TRULY BELIEVE

121
00:05:19,901 --> 00:05:21,667
THE STAKES COULDN'T BE HIGHER.

122
00:05:21,667 --> 00:05:23,267
IT'S TRUE,
AS ROSS POINTED OUT,

123
00:05:23,267 --> 00:05:27,834
THAT WE DON'T HAVE PROPONENTS
OF PROP 8 ON THIS PANEL.

124
00:05:27,834 --> 00:05:30,467
BUT I DID GROW UP MORMON
IN UTAH,

125
00:05:30,467 --> 00:05:34,767
SO IF ANYONE WANTS TO--
THE ARGUMENT'S PRESENTED--

126
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:38,067
I'M MORE THAN HAPPY
TO GO BACK TO MY ROOTS

127
00:05:38,067 --> 00:05:40,934
BECAUSE THE CHURCH
OF MY CHILDHOOD IS A VERY

128
00:05:40,934 --> 00:05:43,534
VIGOROUS PROPONENT
OF PROP 8.

129
00:05:43,534 --> 00:05:45,634
AND WE'VE SEEN A LOT
OF THEIR MESSAGING.

130
00:05:45,634 --> 00:05:47,434
AND I'VE BEEN
IN SOME CONVERSATIONS

131
00:05:47,434 --> 00:05:50,133
WITH SOME OF MY OWN
FAMILY MEMBERS

132
00:05:50,133 --> 00:05:54,767
ABOUT PROP 8, AND IT DOES
STIMULATE SIGNIFICANT VIEWS

133
00:05:54,767 --> 00:05:57,033
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
AND IN THE COUNTRY.

134
00:05:57,033 --> 00:05:59,234
BUT ONE THING
THAT IS BECOMING CLEAR

135
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:01,567
IS THAT PEOPLE
ARE RECOGNIZING

136
00:06:01,567 --> 00:06:03,667
THAT WE NOW
LIVE IN A STATE

137
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:06,534
THAT TREATS
ALL PEOPLE EQUALLY

138
00:06:06,534 --> 00:06:08,934
WHEN IT COMES
TO THE RIGHT TO MARRY.

139
00:06:08,934 --> 00:06:14,334
EVERYONE IN THIS STATE CAN MARRY
THE PERSON THAT THEY LOVE.

140
00:06:14,334 --> 00:06:18,601
THAT IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT--
[applause]

141
00:06:18,601 --> 00:06:22,467
THAT IS SUCH
AN IMPORTANT RIGHT.

142
00:06:22,467 --> 00:06:25,300
IT IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT WAY
OF BEING.

143
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,801
IT IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT WAY
OF UNDERSTANDING

144
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:30,434
ONE'S SELF
AND ONE'S RELATIONSHIP.

145
00:06:30,434 --> 00:06:33,801
NO ONE SHOULD GROW UP FEELING
AS IF THEIR RELATIONSHIP

146
00:06:33,801 --> 00:06:35,367
IS SUBSTANDARD.

147
00:06:35,367 --> 00:06:37,334
THAT THEIR RELATIONSHIP
DOESN'T MATTER.

148
00:06:37,334 --> 00:06:40,667
THAT THEIR LOVE IS NOT REGARDED
EQUALLY UNDER THE LAW.

149
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:43,801
AND WE NOW LIVE IN A STATE
WHERE THAT IS THE CASE,

150
00:06:43,801 --> 00:06:46,767
AND IT IS A TRULY LANDMARK

151
00:06:46,767 --> 00:06:48,100
AND HISTORIC MOMENT.

152
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,367
SO WHAT VOTERS ARE FACING,
AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING

153
00:06:51,367 --> 00:06:52,801
IN SOME OF THE MESSAGING
AND THE POLLING

154
00:06:52,801 --> 00:06:54,767
THAT STEVE'S GONNA TALK ABOUT
IN A FEW MINUTES--

155
00:06:54,767 --> 00:06:57,767
WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT FACED
WITH THE QUESTION

156
00:06:57,767 --> 00:07:00,534
OF WHETHER FOLKS ARE REALLY
WILLING TO ELIMINATE

157
00:07:00,534 --> 00:07:04,667
THE RIGHT OF SAME-SEX COUPLES
TO MARRY--

158
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:07,267
WE ARE FINDING THAT REGARDLESS
OF HOW PEOPLE FEEL

159
00:07:07,267 --> 00:07:12,868
ABOUT SAME-SEX COUPLES MARRYING,
THEY REALLY DO NOT HAVE

160
00:07:12,868 --> 00:07:15,634
THE POLITICAL STOMACH--
IT IS TRENDING THIS WAY,

161
00:07:15,634 --> 00:07:17,534
ALTHOUGH IT'S VERY,
VERY CLOSE--

162
00:07:17,534 --> 00:07:21,400
TO ELIMINATE
THAT FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT.

163
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,067
FOR THOSE OF YOU
WHO HAVEN'T SEEN

164
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:26,000
THE ACTUAL LANGUAGE
OF THE INITIATIVE,

165
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,901
IT'S VERY SIMPLE AND THIS IS HOW
IT WILL APPEAR ON THE BALLOT.

166
00:07:29,901 --> 00:07:32,400
ARGUMENT LANGUAGE
THAT EVERYONE WILL BE GETTING

167
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,100
IN THEIR MAILBOXES
THE FIRST WEEK IN OCTOBER.

168
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,634
IT'S PROPOSITION 8.

169
00:07:36,634 --> 00:07:37,968
THIS IS THE TITLE:

170
00:07:37,968 --> 00:07:40,934
"ELIMINATES RIGHT
OF SAME-SEX COUPLES TO MARRY."

171
00:07:40,934 --> 00:07:42,667
AND THEN, OF COURSE,
THESE ARE THE STAKES

172
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:44,067
THAT MAKE IT SO HIGH.

173
00:07:44,067 --> 00:07:46,767
IT IS A CONSTITUTIONAL
AMENDMENT.

174
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:49,434
THE HIGHEST LAW
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

175
00:07:49,434 --> 00:07:52,334
AND THEN IT'S 13 QUICK WORDS.

176
00:07:52,334 --> 00:07:55,100
"CHANGES CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION
TO ELIMINATE THE RIGHT

177
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,667
OF SAME-SEX COUPLES TO MARRY."

178
00:07:56,667 --> 00:07:58,267
AND THIS IS THE KEY LANGUAGE:

179
00:07:58,267 --> 00:08:00,400
"PROVIDES THAT ONLY MARRIAGE
BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN

180
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,133
IS VALID OR RECOGNIZED
IN CALIFORNIA."

181
00:08:03,133 --> 00:08:05,767
NOW THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE
ARE VOTING ON,

182
00:08:05,767 --> 00:08:07,934
AND IT IS IMPORTANT
FOR EVERYONE TO UNDERSTAND

183
00:08:07,934 --> 00:08:11,400
WHAT THE LANGUAGE IS
AND THAT IT'S NOT A SITUATION

184
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,133
WHERE WE'RE SAYING
YOU HAVE TO BE CELEBRATING

185
00:08:14,133 --> 00:08:16,868
THE RIGHT OF SAME-SEX COUPLES
TO MARRY,

186
00:08:16,868 --> 00:08:19,100
ALTHOUGH FOR THOSE
WHO HAVE GOTTEN MARRIED

187
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,701
OR ATTENDED WEDDINGS,
IT'S A VERY MOVING

188
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:24,000
AND CELEBRATORY EXPERIENCE.

189
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,701
THE ISSUE IS,
ARE YOU WILLING TO ELIMINATE

190
00:08:26,701 --> 00:08:29,367
THIS VERY IMPORTANT,
FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT

191
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:32,100
FOR A WHOLE CATEGORY
OF CALIFORNIANS?

192
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,000
"WHY VOTE NO?"

193
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,467
AND THIS IS EASY MESSAGING

194
00:08:35,467 --> 00:08:37,434
THAT YOU ALL COULD WRITE
YOURSELVES,

195
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,234
THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE OPPOSED
TO PROP 8,

196
00:08:39,234 --> 00:08:40,834
THAT WE DON'T ELIMINATE
FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS

197
00:08:40,834 --> 00:08:43,234
IN THIS COUNTRY.

198
00:08:43,234 --> 00:08:47,133
THAT IT'S WRONG TO TAKE
A CATEGORY OF PEOPLE AND SAY,

199
00:08:47,133 --> 00:08:48,501
"YOU ARE GOING
TO BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY

200
00:08:48,501 --> 00:08:50,734
"THAN ANYBODY ELSE BASED
ON A FACTOR

201
00:08:50,734 --> 00:08:54,000
THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH YOUR ABILITY."

202
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,801
THAT SAME-SEX COUPLES
AND INDIVIDUALS

203
00:08:56,801 --> 00:08:58,834
ARE PART OF CALIFORNIA.

204
00:08:58,834 --> 00:09:00,467
A PART OF THIS COUNTRY.

205
00:09:00,467 --> 00:09:01,934
THIS IS WHO WE ARE.

206
00:09:01,934 --> 00:09:04,334
THIS IS PART OF WHAT MAKES
THIS STATE GREAT.

207
00:09:04,334 --> 00:09:07,467
PART OF THE DIVERSITY
THAT MAKES THIS STATE GREAT.

208
00:09:07,467 --> 00:09:09,834
WE HEAR ARGUMENTS
FROM THE OTHER SIDE,

209
00:09:09,834 --> 00:09:12,100
AND THE MAIN ARGUMENTS
THAT THEY ARE MAKING--

210
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,067
ONE OF THE KEY ONES--
IS THAT CALIFORNIA

211
00:09:15,067 --> 00:09:17,234
HAS MUSCULAR
DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIPS

212
00:09:17,234 --> 00:09:19,334
THAT PROTECT SAME-SEX COUPLES.

213
00:09:19,334 --> 00:09:20,868
WE DON'T NEED MARRIAGE.

214
00:09:20,868 --> 00:09:23,534
MARRIAGE SHOULD JUST BE
BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN.

215
00:09:23,534 --> 00:09:25,501
WELL, WE ALL KNOW--
WHO HAVE HAD EXPERIENCE

216
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:28,367
WITH DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIPS--
THAT IT'S NOT THE SAME.

217
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:30,234
IT'S NOT THE SAME VOCABULARY.

218
00:09:30,234 --> 00:09:32,267
THERE'S NOT
A COMMON UNDERSTANDING.

219
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:34,133
COUPLES WHO ARE
IN DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIPS

220
00:09:34,133 --> 00:09:35,701
STILL FACE ENDLESS QUESTIONS

221
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:38,033
ABOUT WHO THEY REALLY ARE
TO EACH OTHER.

222
00:09:38,033 --> 00:09:40,868
AND WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT,
WE NOW HAVE THE RIGHT TO MARRY

223
00:09:40,868 --> 00:09:43,834
IN THIS STATE, AND ELIMINATING
THAT FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT

224
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:48,200
IS NOT SOMETHING
THAT WE SHOULD BE VOTING ON,

225
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,534
AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT
VOTERS SHOULD VOTE "YES" ON.

226
00:09:51,534 --> 00:09:54,934
WE ARE DOING BETTER THAN THAT
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

227
00:09:54,934 --> 00:09:57,367
OUR POLLING RIGHT NOW--
AND I KNOW PEOPLE HAVE SEEN

228
00:09:57,367 --> 00:10:01,767
A LOT OF PUBLIC POLLS THAT
SHOW US SIGNIFICANTLY AHEAD.

229
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,234
THE "NO" VOTE SIGNIFICANTLY
AHEAD OF THE "YES" VOTE.

230
00:10:04,234 --> 00:10:08,667
WE ARE MUCH CLOSER THAN SOME
OF THOSE POLLS SHOW.

231
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:11,033
AND THERE'S ALL SORTS
OF DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES

232
00:10:11,033 --> 00:10:12,801
THAT STEVE
CAN TALK ABOUT MORE,

233
00:10:12,801 --> 00:10:14,367
BUT WHAT YOU ALL
NEED TO UNDERSTAND,

234
00:10:14,367 --> 00:10:16,901
AND WHAT'S IMPORTANT FOR US
TO UNDERSTAND IN THIS FIGHT,

235
00:10:16,901 --> 00:10:18,934
IS THAT WHILE
IT'S IMMINENTLY WINNABLE,

236
00:10:18,934 --> 00:10:21,033
IT IS A DEAD HEAT.

237
00:10:21,033 --> 00:10:23,767
AND THE "UNDECIDED" UNIVERSE
IS MUCH SMALLER

238
00:10:23,767 --> 00:10:26,434
THAN ON USUALLY ANY
OTHER QUESTION AT THIS TIME

239
00:10:26,434 --> 00:10:29,467
AND THOSE "UNDECIDEDS"
ARE THE FOLKS

240
00:10:29,467 --> 00:10:32,601
WHO WE REALLY NEED TO REACH,
AND WHO NEED TO UNDERSTAND

241
00:10:32,601 --> 00:10:35,968
THE MESSAGE
OF WHAT THE HARM WOULD BE.

242
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,067
THIS IS NOT A NEUTRAL VOTE.

243
00:10:38,067 --> 00:10:40,467
A VOTE TO ELIMINATE
THE RIGHTS OF ANY CATEGORY

244
00:10:40,467 --> 00:10:43,067
OF PEOPLE DOES HARM,
AND IT CERTAINLY DOES HARM--

245
00:10:43,067 --> 00:10:45,334
WILL DO HARM--
TO SAME-SEX COUPLES,

246
00:10:45,334 --> 00:10:47,601
AND THEIR FAMILIES,
AND PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT THEM

247
00:10:47,601 --> 00:10:50,234
IN TERMS OF THEIR STATUS
UNDER THE LAW.

248
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:54,400
SO THAT UNDECIDED POOL,
PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND

249
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,033
THAT IT'S A SMALL UNIVERSE
OF DONORS.

250
00:10:56,033 --> 00:10:57,601
THEY'RE EVERYWHERE.

251
00:10:57,601 --> 00:11:00,000
THEY'RE NOT
IN ANY ONE DEMOGRAPHIC.

252
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,834
THEY'RE ALL UP AND DOWN
THE STATE.

253
00:11:01,834 --> 00:11:04,968
BUT RIGHT NOW WE ARE
IN A NECK-AND-NECK RACE,

254
00:11:04,968 --> 00:11:08,501
AND AS WE GO
INTO THE ADVERTISING SEASON,

255
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,267
IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY,
ENORMOUSLY IMPORTANT

256
00:11:11,267 --> 00:11:15,467
THAT WE HAVE THE MUSCULAR
CAMPAIGN TO BE UP,

257
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:18,667
TO BE UP EARLY, AND TO MAKE SURE
WE CAPTURE THOSE UNDECIDEDS.

258
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:21,100
SO THE CAMPAIGN STRUCTURE.

259
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:24,000
THERE'S NOT ANY CAMPAIGN
THAT CAN EVER WIN

260
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,400
IN CALIFORNIA STATEWIDE
BASED ON JUST VOLUNTEERS,

261
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,133
OR JUST THOSE OF US

262
00:11:30,133 --> 00:11:31,734
WHO ARE LEADERS
ON ANY PARTICULAR ISSUE,

263
00:11:31,734 --> 00:11:35,133
WHETHER IT'S RACIAL JUSTICE
AND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION,

264
00:11:35,133 --> 00:11:36,601
OR WHETHER IT'S
PARENTAL NOTIFICATION

265
00:11:36,601 --> 00:11:39,601
AS STEVE HAS WORKED ON BEFORE,
YOU NEED PROFESSIONALS.

266
00:11:39,601 --> 00:11:43,667
AND WE KNEW THAT EARLY ON,
SO WE WENT TO TWO

267
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:48,801
OF THE BEST OPERATIONS AND
THE BEST SHOPS IN THE COUNTRY

268
00:11:48,801 --> 00:11:51,334
TO BE THE PROFESSIONALS
ON OUR CAMPAIGN.

269
00:11:51,334 --> 00:11:53,067
YOU'LL HEAR IN A MOMENT
FROM DEWEY SQUARE.

270
00:11:53,067 --> 00:11:56,934
ROSS OBVIOUSLY DID GREAT JUSTICE
TO STEVE'S CREDENTIALS

271
00:11:56,934 --> 00:12:01,100
AS OUR GENERAL CONSULTANT,
AND YOU'LL HEAR MORE FROM HIM.

272
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,567
WORKING HAND-IN-HAND
WITH STEVE

273
00:12:02,567 --> 00:12:07,000
IS OGILVY PUBLIC RELATIONS--
ALSO HAS WON NUMEROUS CAMPAIGNS

274
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,634
STATEWIDE IN CALIFORNIA--
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MESSAGING

275
00:12:10,634 --> 00:12:14,000
THAT THE VOTERS SEE--
HOW YOU WIN CAMPAIGNS

276
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,901
IN CALIFORNIA
IS THOSE ADS THAT PEOPLE SEE.

277
00:12:16,901 --> 00:12:18,667
EVEN THOUGH WE ALL,
BY NOVEMBER 4th,

278
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:20,667
WILL BE COMPLETELY SICK
OF THEM,

279
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:25,501
THAT MESSAGING FRAMES HOW
PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THIS ISSUE.

280
00:12:25,501 --> 00:12:27,434
AND OGILVY,
THEY'RE PROS AT DOING THIS,

281
00:12:27,434 --> 00:12:28,968
AND WE FEEL
VERY CONFIDENT WITH THEM.

282
00:12:28,968 --> 00:12:31,400
WE HAVE UNPRECEDENTED
PARTNERSHIPS

283
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,734
THROUGHOUT THE STATE,
AND I'M JUST GONNA GO

284
00:12:32,734 --> 00:12:33,868
THROUGH THESE QUICKLY.

285
00:12:33,868 --> 00:12:35,334
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO READ 'EM ALL

286
00:12:35,334 --> 00:12:37,267
BECAUSE THERE'S JUST--
THERE'S SO MANY

287
00:12:37,267 --> 00:12:39,400
WHO ARE SUPPORTING.

288
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,901
AND THIS BUSINESS LIST
IS ONLY PARTIAL.

289
00:12:40,901 --> 00:12:42,701
THERE ARE MANY MORE
ORGANIZATIONS,

290
00:12:42,701 --> 00:12:44,267
AND BUSINESSES,
AND CORPORATIONS

291
00:12:44,267 --> 00:12:46,934
THAT ARE IN PROCESS
IN MAKING DECISIONS

292
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:48,467
ABOUT SUPPORTING PROP 8.

293
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,434
WE BELIEVE THIS LIST
WILL BE VERY LONG.

294
00:12:50,434 --> 00:12:52,901
STATEWIDE ORGANIZATIONS.

295
00:12:52,901 --> 00:12:54,667
AND IT RUNS THE GAMUT.

296
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:56,901
IT'S NOT JUST
LGBT ORGANIZATIONS.

297
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,901
IT'S EVERYONE WHO WANTS
TO LIVE IN A STATE

298
00:12:58,901 --> 00:13:02,067
WHERE PEOPLE ARE TREATED FAIRLY
AND EQUALLY.

299
00:13:02,067 --> 00:13:03,501
THOSE ARE JUST
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES.

300
00:13:03,501 --> 00:13:06,400
THAT'S ACTUALLY
A CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLE.

301
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,400
THE GOVERNMENT
DOESN'T MAKE DECISIONS

302
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,734
ABOUT WHO PEOPLE MARRY.

303
00:13:10,734 --> 00:13:12,300
GOVERNMENT STAYS
OUTTA THAT BUSINESS.

304
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,868
THE LAW TREATS
EVERYONE EQUALLY.

305
00:13:13,868 --> 00:13:15,400
AND SO WE HAVE SUPPORT
FROM ALL SORTS

306
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:19,367
OF CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS,
FROM MAINSTREAM ORGANIZATIONS,

307
00:13:19,367 --> 00:13:22,701
FROM RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS.

308
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:25,634
IT HAS REALLY BEEN
A VERY GRATIFYING CAMPAIGN

309
00:13:25,634 --> 00:13:27,100
TO BE INVOLVED IN.

310
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,734
SO FUNDRAISING--BECAUSE THIS
IS WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO, FOLKS.

311
00:13:29,734 --> 00:13:32,801
AND I WISH IT WASN'T
JUST ABOUT THE MONEY.

312
00:13:32,801 --> 00:13:34,667
I WISH IT WAS ABOUT,
YOU KNOW,

313
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:36,334
"LET ME JUST HAVE
A CONVERSATION WITH YOU."

314
00:13:36,334 --> 00:13:37,667
AND "LET'S WORK IT ALL OUT."

315
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:39,367
AND "LET ME GET YOU
TO VOTE 'NO'."

316
00:13:39,367 --> 00:13:41,267
BUT IT'S ABOUT MONEY.

317
00:13:41,267 --> 00:13:43,601
AND SO FAR WE'VE RAISED
OVER $10 MILLION.

318
00:13:43,601 --> 00:13:49,601
THAT IS UNPRECEDENTED
FOR A GAY ISSUE IN THE COUNTRY.

319
00:13:49,601 --> 00:13:52,501
NEVER BEFORE HAS THAT KIND
OF MONEY BEEN RAISED

320
00:13:52,501 --> 00:13:54,267
FROM 32,000 DONORS.

321
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:55,901
NEVER BEFORE
FROM THAT MANY DONORS.

322
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:57,667
BUT YOU CAN ALL DO THE MATH.

323
00:13:57,667 --> 00:13:59,367
YOU KNOW THERE ARE
A LOT MORE PEOPLE OUT THERE

324
00:13:59,367 --> 00:14:01,834
WHO HAVEN'T GIVEN,
THAT CAN GIVE,

325
00:14:01,834 --> 00:14:03,367
AND HAVE THE CAPACITY TO GIVE.

326
00:14:03,367 --> 00:14:04,901
AND THAT $10 MILLION,

327
00:14:04,901 --> 00:14:06,534
NOT GONNA DO IT.

328
00:14:06,534 --> 00:14:07,734
WE KNEW
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING

329
00:14:07,734 --> 00:14:10,033
THIS WAS GONNA BE
A $20 MILLION CAMPAIGN.

330
00:14:10,033 --> 00:14:12,567
AND EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE SEEING
FROM OUR OPPOSITION

331
00:14:12,567 --> 00:14:15,701
IS NOT ONLY THAT IT'S GONNA BE
A $20 MILLION CAMPAIGN,

332
00:14:15,701 --> 00:14:17,901
BUT IT'S PROBABLY GONNA BE
A 24 OR 25,

333
00:14:17,901 --> 00:14:20,100
MAYBE $26 MILLION CAMPAIGN.

334
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,467
AND THAT'S JUST COLD,
HARD FACT.

335
00:14:23,467 --> 00:14:25,000
WE BELIEVE WE CAN RAISE IT.

336
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,934
BUT IT WILL TAKE PEOPLE WHO'VE
NEVER WRITTEN A CHECK BEFORE

337
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:32,334
TO A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN
FOR US TO GET TO THAT MARK.

338
00:14:32,334 --> 00:14:34,167
WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST--

339
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:36,767
AND WE'VE SEEN THIS MONEY
POURING INTO THE OTHER SIDE,

340
00:14:36,767 --> 00:14:39,567
MAINLY FROM, SO FAR,
THE KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS,

341
00:14:39,567 --> 00:14:41,200
THE MORMON CHURCH,
AND FOCUS ON THE FAMILY.

342
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,767
THESE ARE VERY LOW DOLLARS.

343
00:14:42,767 --> 00:14:46,467
THEY'LL BE FOUR, FIVE,
SIX, TEN, MAYBE 20 TIMES THAT

344
00:14:46,467 --> 00:14:48,000
BY THE TIME WE'RE DONE.

345
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,434
AND WE JUST HAVE TO MATCH THEM
DOLLAR-FOR-DOLLAR.

346
00:14:50,434 --> 00:14:53,400
THE MEDIA BUY TO DO THIS--

347
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,868
WE GO UP OCTOBER 6th
IN ALL THESE MAJOR MARKETS.

348
00:14:57,868 --> 00:14:59,901
AND WE'RE IN ALL THOSE MARKETS
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE

349
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:02,033
ALL OUR UNDECIDED VOTERS ARE.

350
00:15:02,033 --> 00:15:07,434
I WISH THEY WERE ALL IN A SMALL
NEIGHBORHOOD IN LOS GATOS.

351
00:15:07,434 --> 00:15:09,667
THAT WOULD MAKE IT
SO MUCH EASIER.

352
00:15:09,667 --> 00:15:10,868
BUT THEY ARE EVERYWHERE.

353
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,567
THEY'RE IN EVERY AGE GROUP.

354
00:15:12,567 --> 00:15:15,234
THEY'RE BOTH REPUBLICAN
AND THEY'RE DEMOCRAT.

355
00:15:15,234 --> 00:15:16,267
THEY'RE LATINO.

356
00:15:16,267 --> 00:15:17,567
THEY'RE AFRICAN-AMERICAN.

357
00:15:17,567 --> 00:15:18,601
THEY'RE WHITE.

358
00:15:18,601 --> 00:15:20,167
THEY'RE BLUE-COLLAR.

359
00:15:20,167 --> 00:15:21,200
THEY'RE WEALTHY.

360
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,267
THEY'RE OLDER.

361
00:15:22,267 --> 00:15:23,734
I MEAN, THEY ARE EVERYONE.

362
00:15:23,734 --> 00:15:28,634
THE "UNDECIDED" UNIVERSE
IS EVERYONE THAT YOU KNOW

363
00:15:28,634 --> 00:15:31,601
IN YOUR LIFE EXPERIENCE,
AND THOSE ARE THE FOLKS

364
00:15:31,601 --> 00:15:33,167
THAT WE NEED TO REACH,
AND THAT'S THE CHALLENGE

365
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:34,601
IN THIS CAMPAIGN,

366
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:38,467
TO REACH THEM ALL
AND TO MOVE THEM TO A "NO."

367
00:15:38,467 --> 00:15:40,634
DONALD WILDMON,
WHO IS PRESIDENT

368
00:15:40,634 --> 00:15:42,334
OF THE AMERICAN FAMILY
ASSOCIATION--

369
00:15:42,334 --> 00:15:46,200
ONE OF, I WILL SAY,
THE MOST VITRIOLICLY NASTY

370
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,000
ANTI-GAY ORGANIZATIONS
IN THE COUNTRY.

371
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,667
AND PEOPLE CAN DISAGREE
AROUND THE IDEA

372
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:53,100
OF LESBIAN AND GAY PEOPLE
MARRYING,

373
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,801
AND THEY'RE NOT ANTI-GAY.

374
00:15:54,801 --> 00:15:56,400
I WANNA BE CLEAR
ABOUT THAT.

375
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,501
PEOPLE CAN BE UNCOMFORTABLE
WITH THE IDEA

376
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:02,000
OF SAME-SEX COUPLES MARRYING,
AND THAT DOES NOT

377
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,667
MAKE THEM ANTI-GAY.

378
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:07,133
DONALD WILDMON,
ANTI-GAY.

379
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,234
AND HE HAS MADE
A LIFE'S WORK

380
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:13,167
OUT OF REALLY PUTTING FORWARD--
SPEWING FORWARD--

381
00:16:13,167 --> 00:16:15,901
THE MOST VICIOUS,
FEAR-MONGERING

382
00:16:15,901 --> 00:16:18,634
ABOUT LESBIAN AND GAY PEOPLE,
AND THIS IS WHAT HE SAYS.

383
00:16:18,634 --> 00:16:20,100
"IF WE LOSE IN CALIFORNIA,

384
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,434
"IF THEY DEFEAT THE MARRIAGE
AMENDMENT, WE'RE DONE.

385
00:16:23,434 --> 00:16:26,133
THEY'VE WON THE CULTURE WARS."

386
00:16:26,133 --> 00:16:29,834
NOW, FOLKS, IT WOULD BE GOOD
TO HAVE THAT WIN.

387
00:16:29,834 --> 00:16:34,901
BUT IF HE IS FRAMING IT
THAT WAY--

388
00:16:34,901 --> 00:16:38,167
A MAN WHO HAS MADE
A LIFE'S WORK OF DEMONIZING

389
00:16:38,167 --> 00:16:41,200
LESBIAN AND GAY PEOPLE--
THEN IF YOU CARE

390
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,267
ABOUT ANYONE WHO IS LGBT,

391
00:16:44,267 --> 00:16:46,868
IF YOU ARE LGBT YOURSELF,
IF YOU CARE

392
00:16:46,868 --> 00:16:48,601
ABOUT PROGRESSIVE ISSUES,

393
00:16:48,601 --> 00:16:51,767
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT
THAT'S WHAT'S AT STAKE AS WELL.

394
00:16:51,767 --> 00:16:55,267
BECAUSE HE'S GOT THE PASSION,
AND THAT'S HOW YOU FUND

395
00:16:55,267 --> 00:16:57,033
AND SUPPORT THIS CAMPAIGN.

396
00:16:57,033 --> 00:16:59,133
WE'VE GOTTA HAVE
THE SAME THING.

397
00:16:59,133 --> 00:17:02,567
SO OUR MESSAGE IS A SIMPLE ONE.

398
00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:05,901
DON'T ELIMINATE
THE RIGHT TO MARRY FOR ANYONE.

399
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:08,167
IT'S A "VOTE NO" ON PROP 8,
AND GET EVERYONE YOU KNOW

400
00:17:08,167 --> 00:17:09,868
TO DO THE SAME.

401
00:17:09,868 --> 00:17:12,934
THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT
NATIONAL IMPLICATIONS

402
00:17:12,934 --> 00:17:14,934
TO WHAT WE'RE FACING.

403
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:18,434
AND PATRICK GUERRIERO
AND GILL ACTION

404
00:17:18,434 --> 00:17:21,834
UNDERSTANDS THOSE RAMIFICATIONS
AND HOW THEY FEED IN--

405
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:25,133
AND HOW CALIFORNIA FEEDS INTO
THAT AND EFFECTS THE COUNTRY

406
00:17:25,133 --> 00:17:28,300
PROBABLY BETTER THAN ANYONE
IN THE NATION.

407
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:32,367
HE IS A DEAR COLLEAGUE, AND IT
IS REALLY A PLEASURE FOR ME

408
00:17:32,367 --> 00:17:34,200
TO ACTUALLY SEE YOU IN PERSON,
SINCE WE'VE BEEN EXCHANGING

409
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,968
THREE OR FOUR EMAILS
ALMOST EVERY SINGLE DAY

410
00:17:35,968 --> 00:17:38,334
FOR THE LAST THREE MONTHS
AS WE WORK ON THE CAMPAIGN.

411
00:17:38,334 --> 00:17:40,534
SO I'LL LET PATRICK TALK
ABOUT THE NATIONAL PICTURE.

412
00:17:40,534 --> 00:17:41,934
Guerriero:
THANKS, KATE.

413
00:17:41,934 --> 00:17:43,501
THE, UM, YOU KNOW, KATE--

414
00:17:43,501 --> 00:17:49,167
[applause]

415
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:51,834
KATE NOT ONLY BRINGS
OBVIOUSLY GREAT INTELLECT

416
00:17:51,834 --> 00:17:55,934
TO THIS ARGUMENT, BUT ALSO
A GREAT DEAL OF EMOTION.

417
00:17:55,934 --> 00:17:58,234
AND IT'S HARD NOT TO BE
EMOTIONAL AND PASSIONATE

418
00:17:58,234 --> 00:18:00,968
ABOUT THIS.

419
00:18:00,968 --> 00:18:03,701
I KNOW LAST NIGHT OVER DINNER--

420
00:18:03,701 --> 00:18:06,400
HAD A CONVERSATION
WITH SOME FOLKS,

421
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,033
AND IT'S A SENSE THAT WE ARE
ON THE BALLOT.

422
00:18:11,033 --> 00:18:13,534
I MEAN, THIS IS NOT A BALLOT--
COMING FROM CALIFORNIA,

423
00:18:13,534 --> 00:18:15,300
YOU'RE USED TO A LOT
OF BALLOT INITIATIVES.

424
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,834
THIS IS A UNIQUE ONE
IN THAT HUMAN BEINGS, US,

425
00:18:17,834 --> 00:18:23,501
OUR FRIENDS, OUR NEIGHBORS,
OUR PARTNERS ARE ON THE BALLOT.

426
00:18:23,501 --> 00:18:26,534
AND OUR DIGNITY, OUR BASIC
FAIRNESS IS ON THE BALLOT.

427
00:18:26,534 --> 00:18:28,167
THERE'S A LOT OF EMOTION
THAT COMES WITH THAT.

428
00:18:28,167 --> 00:18:30,000
AND FOR THOSE OF US

429
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,434
WHO BELIEVE THAT WE'RE
LIVING THROUGH THE KIND

430
00:18:32,434 --> 00:18:35,601
OF CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT
OF OUR GENERATION,

431
00:18:35,601 --> 00:18:38,601
IT'S DIFFICULT NOT TO HAVE
THE BLOOD PRESSURE GO UP,

432
00:18:38,601 --> 00:18:42,200
AND TO BE ANXIOUS,
AND TO COME AT THIS CAMPAIGN

433
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,634
FROM A VERY,
VERY EMOTIONAL PLACE.

434
00:18:44,634 --> 00:18:48,501
WHICH IS WHY I
OFTEN BECOME THE, UM,

435
00:18:48,501 --> 00:18:49,868
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PERSON
IN THE ROOM

436
00:18:49,868 --> 00:18:53,334
BECAUSE I COME FROM A UNIVERSE
IN RUNNING GILL ACTION--

437
00:18:53,334 --> 00:18:56,300
WHICH IS A ORGANIZATION
THAT INVESTS

438
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,868
IN EDUCATION AND ADVOCACY
IN HARDCORE POLITICAL WORK

439
00:18:58,868 --> 00:19:00,667
AROUND THE COUNTRY.

440
00:19:00,667 --> 00:19:04,133
I COME FROM A LENS THAT
IS REMARKABLY DISPASSIONATE

441
00:19:04,133 --> 00:19:08,234
SOMETIMES, UNEMOTIONAL,
DEEPLY DATA-DRIVEN,

442
00:19:08,234 --> 00:19:11,834
DEEPLY RESEARCH-DRIVEN,
DEEPLY POLL-DRIVEN,

443
00:19:11,834 --> 00:19:14,634
BECAUSE THERE ARE
A WHOLE LOT OF BATTLES

444
00:19:14,634 --> 00:19:16,501
THAT ARE BEING FOUGHT
ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY

445
00:19:16,501 --> 00:19:19,067
THAT MATTER
TO NOT ONLY LGBT PEOPLE,

446
00:19:19,067 --> 00:19:22,133
BUT PROGRESSIVE PEOPLE
ALL OVER THE NATION.

447
00:19:22,133 --> 00:19:24,467
AND IN DOING SO,
PART OF OUR JOB

448
00:19:24,467 --> 00:19:28,400
IS TO GO BACK TO OUR DONOR,
AND HIS NAME IS TIM GILL,

449
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,801
WHO'S ONE OF THE MOST
GENEROUS PHILANTHROPISTS

450
00:19:30,801 --> 00:19:32,467
AND POLITICAL INVESTORS
IN THE NATION,

451
00:19:32,467 --> 00:19:35,133
AND A GROUP OF OTHER DONORS,
GENEROUS DONORS

452
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:38,634
AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT WE GIVE
POLITICAL COUNSEL TO,

453
00:19:38,634 --> 00:19:40,267
AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS
TO THEM

454
00:19:40,267 --> 00:19:42,934
ABOUT THE PLACES WHERE
THEIR MONEY, IF INVESTED,

455
00:19:42,934 --> 00:19:47,834
CAN MAKE THE MOST DIFFERENCE
IN THE FASTEST AMOUNT OF TIME.

456
00:19:47,834 --> 00:19:50,033
AND WE HAVE LITERALLY
TRAVELED THE COUNTRY.

457
00:19:50,033 --> 00:19:51,701
WE'VE LOOKED
AT EVERY BALLOT INITIATIVE.

458
00:19:51,701 --> 00:19:53,400
WE'VE LOOKED
AT EVERY STATE RACE.

459
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,234
WE'VE LOOKED
AT ALL THE DIFFERENT DYNAMICS

460
00:19:55,234 --> 00:19:58,100
THAT HAPPEN IN AN ELECTION YEAR,
AND WE'VE DECIDED

461
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,934
REALLY RECENTLY, TO BE HONEST,

462
00:19:59,934 --> 00:20:02,701
THAT THIS IS SINGULARLY
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

463
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:06,234
HAPPENING IN NOVEMBER
OTHER THAN THE FEDERAL ELECTION.

464
00:20:06,234 --> 00:20:08,634
WE BELIEVE THIS
HAS HUGE RAMIFICATIONS,

465
00:20:08,634 --> 00:20:12,501
NOT ONLY FOR CALIFORNIA AND
EVERY SINGLE LGBT FAMILY HERE,

466
00:20:12,501 --> 00:20:15,567
BUT SOMETHING YOU
MIGHT NOT BE AWARE OF IS THAT

467
00:20:15,567 --> 00:20:18,267
NOT ONLY WOULD THIS BE
THE FIRST STATE EVER

468
00:20:18,267 --> 00:20:20,601
TO HAVE THE PUBLIC AFFIRM
THE BASIC FAIRNESS

469
00:20:20,601 --> 00:20:24,767
FOR ALL FAMILIES,
BUT THERE ARE

470
00:20:24,767 --> 00:20:26,767
A NUMBER OF STATES THAT
LITERALLY ARE WAITING

471
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,300
AND WATCHING TO SEE

472
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,834
WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS STATE.

473
00:20:29,834 --> 00:20:31,467
AND I'LL GIVE YOU
A FEW EXAMPLES.

474
00:20:31,467 --> 00:20:34,000
IN NEW YORK,
THE STATE LEGISLATURE

475
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,767
AND THE GOVERNOR ARE VERY CLOSE
TO REACHING A POINT

476
00:20:36,767 --> 00:20:39,834
WHERE THEY COULD PASS
MARRIAGE EQUALITY

477
00:20:39,834 --> 00:20:41,834
AND HAVE THE GOVERNOR
SIGN IT NEXT YEAR.

478
00:20:41,834 --> 00:20:43,234
THEY'RE WATCHING
AND WAITING TO SEE

479
00:20:43,234 --> 00:20:45,067
WHAT HAPPENS IN CALIFORNIA.

480
00:20:45,067 --> 00:20:47,033
IN NEW JERSEY,
WE HAVE A LEGISLATURE

481
00:20:47,033 --> 00:20:50,133
RIGHT ON THE EDGE OF PASSING
MARRIAGE EQUALITY,

482
00:20:50,133 --> 00:20:53,601
AND THE GOVERNOR IS WATCHING
WHAT HAPPENS IN CALIFORNIA

483
00:20:53,601 --> 00:20:57,634
TO DETERMINE WHETHER THIS WILL
PASS THE MUSTER OF THE PUBLIC.

484
00:20:57,634 --> 00:21:01,400
EVEN IN PLACES LIKE IOWA,
THE COURT IS ABOUT TO RULE

485
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,501
OVER THE NEXT 8-12 MONTHS
IN WHAT COULD BE

486
00:21:04,501 --> 00:21:07,033
A HISTORIC DECISION
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY

487
00:21:07,033 --> 00:21:08,501
ABOUT WHETHER
TO AFFIRM THE RIGHTS

488
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:13,000
OF SAME-SEX COUPLES
IN IOWA TO MARRY.

489
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,901
AND YOU BETTER BELIEVE
THAT COURT,

490
00:21:14,901 --> 00:21:17,467
AND THAT LEGISLATURE,
AND THE PUBLIC IN IOWA

491
00:21:17,467 --> 00:21:20,767
IS TAKING A LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS
HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

492
00:21:20,767 --> 00:21:22,000
SO WE HAVE NEVER SEEN

493
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,868
IN ANY STATE BEFORE
A SINGLE BALLOT INITIATIVE

494
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:30,968
THAT WOULD IMPACT MORE PEOPLE
AND IMPACT MORE STATES.

495
00:21:30,968 --> 00:21:33,767
AND WE HAVE ACTUALLY TOLD
A NUMBER OF OUR INVESTORS

496
00:21:33,767 --> 00:21:36,100
AND DONORS THAT WE TALKED TO
THAT WE ACTUALLY THINK

497
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,200
THIS WILL DETERMINE
WHETHER WE'RE ABLE

498
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,434
TO REALIZE FULL EQUALITY FOR
LGBT FAMILIES IN THIS COUNTRY

499
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:46,601
OVER THE NEXT 15 YEARS,
OR WHETHER IT'S GOING TAKE

500
00:21:46,601 --> 00:21:48,567
TWO OR THREE GENERATIONS.

501
00:21:48,567 --> 00:21:51,334
15 YEARS VERSUS 50 YEARS.

502
00:21:51,334 --> 00:21:55,100
THIS RACE ACTUALLY HAS
THAT TYPE OF EXPONENTIAL EFFECT

503
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,100
ACROSS THE SPECTRUM.

504
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,934
AND WHEN YOU ADD
TO THAT THAT OUR ENEMIES

505
00:21:58,934 --> 00:22:02,167
ARE OFTEN THE ENEMIES
OF THE PRO-CHOICE MOVEMENT,

506
00:22:02,167 --> 00:22:05,434
OFTEN THE ENEMIES
OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT--

507
00:22:05,434 --> 00:22:07,834
WHEN YOU HEAR DON WILDMON
SAYING THIS IS REALLY

508
00:22:07,834 --> 00:22:09,701
GROUND ZERO
FOR THE CULTURE WAR,

509
00:22:09,701 --> 00:22:12,667
THEY ALSO UNDERSTAND
WHAT IS AT STAKE

510
00:22:12,667 --> 00:22:14,267
IN NOVEMBER
HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

511
00:22:14,267 --> 00:22:16,367
AND SO WE'VE DETERMINED THIS
TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT RACE

512
00:22:16,367 --> 00:22:19,300
IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.

513
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:23,000
THAT ALONE THOUGH WOULD NOT LEAD
US TO TELL PEOPLE TO INVEST.

514
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,300
THERE ARE A LOT
OF REALLY IMPORTANT RACES

515
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,267
THAT DON'T MEET
THE CRITERIA TO WIN.

516
00:22:27,267 --> 00:22:31,400
AND SO WE DID A FULL ANALYSIS
OF THIS BALLOT INITIATIVE.

517
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,334
THE FIRST QUESTION IS
CAN YOU WIN BASED ON THE DATA

518
00:22:34,334 --> 00:22:36,501
YOU HAVE AROUND POLLING
AND THE RESEARCH YOU HAVE?

519
00:22:36,501 --> 00:22:40,033
AND THE ANSWER
IS UNEQUIVOCALLY YES.

520
00:22:40,033 --> 00:22:42,934
THE POLLING SHOWS, DEPENDING
ON WHOSE POLL YOU BELIEVE,

521
00:22:42,934 --> 00:22:46,267
THAT WE'RE WITHIN FIVE
TO TEN POINTS UP OR DOWN

522
00:22:46,267 --> 00:22:48,267
DEPENDING ON WHAT
DAY OF THE WEEK IT IS.

523
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:49,567
THE CLIMATE.

524
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:52,000
AND SO THIS IS A--
AND I THINK, KATE,

525
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,667
YOU'VE TERMED IT WELL--
A DEAD HEAT.

526
00:22:54,667 --> 00:22:57,501
A COMPLETE DEAD HEAT
THAT COULD EITHER WIN

527
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:00,767
BY A COUPLE POINTS
OR LOSE BY A COUPLE POINTS.

528
00:23:00,767 --> 00:23:03,200
THE SECOND QUESTION
IS DOES THIS STATE

529
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,968
AND ITS GENEROUS CITIZENS
HAVE THE CAPACITY

530
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:09,367
TO RAISE THE MONEY NECESSARY
TO WAGE A FULL-FLEDGED CAMPAIGN?

531
00:23:09,367 --> 00:23:11,701
IN A LOT OF STATES
THE ANSWER IS "NO."

532
00:23:11,701 --> 00:23:14,400
IN THIS STATE
THE ANSWER IS "YES,"

533
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,701
EXCEPT THAT THERE IS
A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF URGENCY

534
00:23:17,701 --> 00:23:20,334
BECAUSE, LITERALLY,
TV TIME NEEDS TO BE PURCHASED

535
00:23:20,334 --> 00:23:22,868
WITHIN THE NEXT
TWO TO THREE WEEKS.

536
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:25,868
AND I WILL BE SO RAW
AS TO SAY THIS.

537
00:23:25,868 --> 00:23:28,534
FROM THE NUMBERS
WE HAVE SEEN AND ANALYZED,

538
00:23:28,534 --> 00:23:34,033
IF OUR OPPONENTS OUT-RAISE US,
WE WILL LOSE.

539
00:23:34,033 --> 00:23:36,667
THAT'S A TOUGH THING TO SAY.

540
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:38,267
BUT WE REALLY BELIEVE
THAT'S THE CASE,

541
00:23:38,267 --> 00:23:40,934
AND THAT IS A LEVEL
OF URGENCY AROUND MAKING SURE

542
00:23:40,934 --> 00:23:43,167
WE CAN FUND
A FULL-FLEDGED CAMPAIGN.

543
00:23:43,167 --> 00:23:44,334
THE NEXT QUESTION WE ASKED

544
00:23:44,334 --> 00:23:47,801
OURSELVES IS THAT
CAN THE LGBT MOVEMENT,

545
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:51,801
THAT HAS SUCH TREMENDOUS HEROES,
MOVE FROM JUST BEING

546
00:23:51,801 --> 00:23:57,801
A PROGRESSIVE ADVOCACY MOVEMENT
TO ONE THAT ACTUALLY EMPOWERS

547
00:23:57,801 --> 00:23:59,634
SMART, STRATEGIC,
POLITICAL THINKERS

548
00:23:59,634 --> 00:24:03,300
TO MAKE HARDCORE POLITICAL
CHOICES TO WIN AN ELECTION?

549
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,667
AND WE'RE CONVINCED
AFTER TAKING A REAL CLOSE LOOK

550
00:24:05,667 --> 00:24:07,434
AT THIS CAMPAIGN
OVER THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS

551
00:24:07,434 --> 00:24:10,067
THAT THEY'VE HIRED
SOME REALLY SMART PEOPLE.

552
00:24:10,067 --> 00:24:13,501
THE BEST AVAILABLE TO RUN
THE SMARTEST CAMPAIGN,

553
00:24:13,501 --> 00:24:16,968
AND THAT THE LGBT ORGANIZATIONS
ARE ALMOST COMPLETELY THERE

554
00:24:16,968 --> 00:24:20,067
IN TERMS OF PUTTING EGO
AND ORGANIZATION ASIDE,

555
00:24:20,067 --> 00:24:22,868
AND MICROMANAGEMENT ASIDE, AND
ALLOWING THE SMARTEST PEOPLE

556
00:24:22,868 --> 00:24:26,601
TO BE EMPOWERED TO MAKE
THE TOUGH CHOICES THAT WILL

557
00:24:26,601 --> 00:24:29,067
TAKE PLACE BETWEEN NOW
AND ELECTION DAY.

558
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:32,267
AND THEN THE LAST PIECE
WE ALWAYS LOOK FOR IS TRENDS.

559
00:24:32,267 --> 00:24:34,634
WHAT WE KNOW IS
THE PUBLIC WITNESSED

560
00:24:34,634 --> 00:24:39,367
A LOT OF WONDERFUL PEOPLE
GETTING MARRIED ONLY WEEKS AGO

561
00:24:39,367 --> 00:24:42,667
FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME
IN THIS STATE.

562
00:24:42,667 --> 00:24:47,000
AND THE PUBLIC WAS TOLD BY
THE FAR-RIGHT THAT THE LOCUSTS

563
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,400
AND PLAGUE WOULD BE HITTING
CALIFORNIA WITHIN DAYS.

564
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,968
SEEMS LIKE WE'VE DONE OKAY
SINCE THOSE MARRIAGES.

565
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,200
I DON'T THINK
ANY HETEROSEXUAL MARRIAGES

566
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,801
HAVE BEEN THREATENED.

567
00:24:55,801 --> 00:24:57,868
SO ALL THE DOOM AND GLOOM
THAT WE ALSO HEARD

568
00:24:57,868 --> 00:24:59,834
IN MASSACHUSETTS,
AND WE ALSO HEARD

569
00:24:59,834 --> 00:25:02,100
THAT WOULD HAPPEN IN CALIFORNIA,
DIDN'T HAPPEN HERE.

570
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,434
AND SO THERE SEEMS TO BE
THIS UNDERLYING BELIEF

571
00:25:05,434 --> 00:25:08,367
THAT THERE IS GOOD ENERGY,
THERE IS A GOOD FEELING HERE,

572
00:25:08,367 --> 00:25:11,467
BUT IT'S GONNA BE DAMN CLOSE
HOWEVER WE LOOK AT IT.

573
00:25:11,467 --> 00:25:12,901
THE GOOD NEWS,

574
00:25:12,901 --> 00:25:15,601
UNDER A FAIRLY UNEMOTIONAL,
DATA-DRIVEN,

575
00:25:15,601 --> 00:25:18,434
POLL-DRIVEN ANALYSIS
OF THE STATUS OF THIS CAMPAIGN,

576
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:23,367
WE ARE WELL POSITIONED TO WIN,
IF WE CAN RAISE THE MONEY

577
00:25:23,367 --> 00:25:25,534
AND DELIVER THE MESSAGE
INTO THE LIVING ROOMS

578
00:25:25,534 --> 00:25:27,067
OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE.

579
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,934
AND ONE OF THE PERSONS
BEST CAPABLE OF DOING THAT

580
00:25:28,934 --> 00:25:30,367
IS STEVE SMITH.

581
00:25:30,367 --> 00:25:34,901
HE'S A FAIRLY MODEST--
AT LEAST MOST OF THE TIME.

582
00:25:34,901 --> 00:25:37,567
BUT STEVE HAS BEEN
DOING BALLOT INITIATIVES

583
00:25:37,567 --> 00:25:38,968
FOR THREE DECADES.

584
00:25:38,968 --> 00:25:40,601
I KIDDED EARLIER
THAT YOU STARTED

585
00:25:40,601 --> 00:25:41,734
WHEN YOU WERE FIVE,
I GUESS.

586
00:25:41,734 --> 00:25:43,400
FOR THREE DECADES,
HE'S BEEN DOING

587
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,701
BALLOT INITIATIVES.

588
00:25:44,701 --> 00:25:47,734
HE'S DONE OVER A DOZEN "NO ON"

589
00:25:47,734 --> 00:25:49,400
CERTAIN BALLOT INITIATIVE
CAMPAIGNS, AND HE'S WON

590
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,200
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM.

591
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,601
AND SO WE'VE PUT THE,
KIND OF, THE TRUST

592
00:25:53,601 --> 00:25:56,601
AND THE CONFIDENCE INTO ONE
OF THE BEST PEOPLE POSSIBLE

593
00:25:56,601 --> 00:25:57,901
TO MAKE SURE WE CAN WIN.

594
00:25:57,901 --> 00:25:59,200
STEVE.

595
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,501
Smith: HOWDY.

596
00:26:00,501 --> 00:26:01,868
YOU KNOW,
IT'S ALWAYS NICE TO KNOW

597
00:26:01,868 --> 00:26:03,601
THAT A REPUBLICAN
FROM MASSACHUSETTS

598
00:26:03,601 --> 00:26:05,601
AND A DEMOCRAT FROM CALIFORNIA
CAN HANG OUT.

599
00:26:05,601 --> 00:26:06,968
GLAD YOU'RE ON MY LEFT.

600
00:26:06,968 --> 00:26:09,634
YEAH, WELL, I'LL ALWAYS BE
ON YOUR LEFT, BROTHER.

601
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:11,267
[chuckling]

602
00:26:11,267 --> 00:26:13,167
LET ME TALK A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT WHERE WE ARE,

603
00:26:13,167 --> 00:26:14,334
AND THEN WHAT
WE GOTTA GET DONE

604
00:26:14,334 --> 00:26:16,901
IN THE NEXT VERY SHORT
PERIOD OF TIME.

605
00:26:16,901 --> 00:26:19,968
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME REFERENCES
HERE ABOUT 40/40/20.

606
00:26:19,968 --> 00:26:21,200
THAT REALLY IS WHERE IT IS.

607
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,868
THERE HAVE BEEN SEVEN POLLS
DONE IN THE LAST--

608
00:26:23,868 --> 00:26:26,601
ABOUT NINE OR TEN WEEKS.

609
00:26:26,601 --> 00:26:28,000
SOME OF THOSE ARE PUBLIC.

610
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,100
SOME OF THOSE ARE PRIVATE.

611
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,400
EVERY ONE OF THEM
HAS COME BACK.

612
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,067
THEY HAD
DIFFERENT RESULTS,

613
00:26:33,067 --> 00:26:36,067
BUT EVERY ONE OF THEM HAS COME
BACK WITHIN THAT 40/40 MARGIN.

614
00:26:36,067 --> 00:26:37,334
SOMETIMES WE'RE AHEAD.

615
00:26:37,334 --> 00:26:38,567
SOMETIMES THEY'RE AHEAD.

616
00:26:38,567 --> 00:26:40,267
BUT THERE'S ALWAYS
THE SAME 20%

617
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:42,901
SWIMMING AROUND OUT THERE.

618
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:46,467
THAT'S THE 20%
THAT WE NEED TO TALK TO,

619
00:26:46,467 --> 00:26:49,200
THAT WE NEED TO CONVINCE
IN THE NEXT TWO MONTHS.

620
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,901
HOW DO YOU CONVINCE THEM?

621
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:53,767
WE ARE NOW--I MEAN, THERE'S BEEN
A LOT OF PREPARATION.

622
00:26:53,767 --> 00:26:56,300
KATE'S BEEN GETTING READY
FOR THIS CAMPAIGN, WHAT,

623
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,300
THREE OR FOUR YEARS?

624
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,467
man: ALL HER LIFE?

625
00:26:58,467 --> 00:26:59,734
Smith: YEAH.

626
00:26:59,734 --> 00:27:01,133
THAT'S A DIFFERENT WAY
TO LOOK AT IT.

627
00:27:01,133 --> 00:27:03,501
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

628
00:27:03,501 --> 00:27:05,067
BUT WE'RE NOW DOWN TO IT.

629
00:27:05,067 --> 00:27:07,501
27 DAYS FROM NOW,
THOSE OF YOU

630
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:09,634
WHO ARE ABSENTEE VOTERS
WILL GO HOME

631
00:27:09,634 --> 00:27:12,100
TO A BALLOT IN YOUR MAILBOX.

632
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,868
30 DAYS LATER,
THE ELECTION HAPPENS.

633
00:27:14,868 --> 00:27:16,367
WE'RE THERE.

634
00:27:16,367 --> 00:27:18,667
NOW THE THING
THAT WE ALL NEED TO DO

635
00:27:18,667 --> 00:27:21,033
IS TALK TO VOTERS.

636
00:27:21,033 --> 00:27:23,634
AND IN THIS ELECTION
IN CALIFORNIA,

637
00:27:23,634 --> 00:27:27,734
THERE WILL BE 12.5,
12.6 MILLION VOTERS.

638
00:27:27,734 --> 00:27:30,834
MORE VOTERS THAN HAVE
EVER CAST A BALLOT

639
00:27:30,834 --> 00:27:33,934
IN ANY SINGLE STATE
IN ANY ELECTION IN THIS COUNTRY.

640
00:27:33,934 --> 00:27:35,267
THAT'S WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
BECAUSE THE TR--

641
00:27:35,267 --> 00:27:36,467
I MEAN, LOOK,
LET'S FACE IT.

642
00:27:36,467 --> 00:27:38,501
THE PRESIDENTIAL
IS ENERGIZING, FOLKS.

643
00:27:38,501 --> 00:27:40,100
THERE'S GONNA BE
A HUGE TURNOUT.

644
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,534
WE HAVE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THAT.

645
00:27:42,534 --> 00:27:46,567
WE HAVE TO TALK
TO THOSE 20% OF THE VOTERS

646
00:27:46,567 --> 00:27:49,534
AND GET THEM
TO COME OUR WAY.

647
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:52,033
I'VE TOLD THIS CLIENT THIS
SEVERAL TIMES.

648
00:27:52,033 --> 00:27:55,000
WHEN I MANAGED
THE "NO ON PROP 85" CAMPAIGN

649
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,167
FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD
TWO YEARS AGO,

650
00:27:57,167 --> 00:28:00,067
LITERALLY, THE FIRST
CAMPAIGN POLL THAT SAID

651
00:28:00,067 --> 00:28:03,567
THAT WE WERE AHEAD, I READ
AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE

652
00:28:03,567 --> 00:28:04,968
ON ELECTION DAY.

653
00:28:04,968 --> 00:28:07,968
WE HAD BEEN BEHIND THE ENTIRE
TIME IN CLOSING THE GAP.

654
00:28:07,968 --> 00:28:10,067
THIS IS NOT THAT KIND
OF SITUATION.

655
00:28:10,067 --> 00:28:11,734
I'VE SEEN POLLS
SAYING WE'RE AHEAD.

656
00:28:11,734 --> 00:28:13,901
I'VE SEEN POLLS SAYING
WE'RE SLIGHTLY BEHIND.

657
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:16,667
BUT WE'RE GONNA DO THIS
RIGHT UP UNTIL THE WIRE,

658
00:28:16,667 --> 00:28:18,467
AND THE ONLY WAY
WE'RE GONNA WIN AGAIN

659
00:28:18,467 --> 00:28:19,901
IS TO TALK TO THOSE VOTERS.

660
00:28:19,901 --> 00:28:21,801
HOW DO YOU TALK
TO VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA?

661
00:28:21,801 --> 00:28:23,934
IT'S CALLED TELEVISION
AND RADIO.

662
00:28:23,934 --> 00:28:25,634
'CAUSE THERE'S
TOO DAMN MANY OF US

663
00:28:25,634 --> 00:28:27,534
TO DO IT ANY OTHER WAY,
FRANKLY.

664
00:28:27,534 --> 00:28:28,767
THIS JUST
IS NOT NEW HAMPSHIRE.

665
00:28:28,767 --> 00:28:30,501
THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT.

666
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:34,501
AND THAT MEANS THAT WE NEED
TO GO UP ON THE TELEVISION,

667
00:28:34,501 --> 00:28:37,501
WE NEED TO BUY MORE ADVERTISING
THAN THEY'RE BUYING,

668
00:28:37,501 --> 00:28:39,868
AND WE NEED TO DELIVER
OUR MESSAGE.

669
00:28:39,868 --> 00:28:42,400
KATE TALKED
ABOUT TALKING TO PEOPLE.

670
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:46,133
YOU CANNOT ELIMINATE
THE RIGHT TO MARRY.

671
00:28:46,133 --> 00:28:48,167
YOU HAVE TO ALLOW
COMMITTED COUPLES

672
00:28:48,167 --> 00:28:49,601
WHO ARE IN LOVE
WITH EACH OTHER

673
00:28:49,601 --> 00:28:51,801
TO GO OUT AND GET MARRIED.

674
00:28:51,801 --> 00:28:53,033
WE'RE THERE NOW.

675
00:28:53,033 --> 00:28:55,968
WE'RE THERE
AFTER A HUGE FIGHT.

676
00:28:55,968 --> 00:28:58,067
WE NOW NEED TO STAY THERE.

677
00:28:58,067 --> 00:29:00,901
AND IN CALIFORNIA,
THE NICE PART ABOUT THIS IS

678
00:29:00,901 --> 00:29:03,734
IT'S ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED
IN SO MANY FORUMS

679
00:29:03,734 --> 00:29:07,667
THAT IF WE WIN THIS,
IT'S DONE.

680
00:29:07,667 --> 00:29:11,968
REMEMBER, THE LEGISLATURE'S
PASSED IT TWICE.

681
00:29:11,968 --> 00:29:15,234
THE GOVERNOR NOW SUPPORTS
OUR SIDE OF THE ISSUE.

682
00:29:15,234 --> 00:29:18,300
THE COURT HAS NOW RULED,
THERE'S ONLY ONE OTHER BODY

683
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,501
OUT THERE
LEFT TO DECIDE.

684
00:29:20,501 --> 00:29:22,367
IT'S CALLED THE VOTERS.

685
00:29:22,367 --> 00:29:27,133
SO IF THE VOTERS
SAY NO ON 8,

686
00:29:27,133 --> 00:29:28,267
WE'RE DONE.

687
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:29,801
THERE IS NO MORE PLACE
FOR THE OTHER SIDE

688
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:32,234
TO PLAY THEIR GAMES.

689
00:29:32,234 --> 00:29:34,100
THAT MEANS WE NEED
TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEM.

690
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,200
ARE WE GONNA GET 1/4 MILLION,
1/2 MILLION

691
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,868
VOLUNTEER PHONE CALLS MADE?

692
00:29:37,868 --> 00:29:39,033
YES.

693
00:29:39,033 --> 00:29:41,567
ARE WE GONNA DO MAIL
AND PHONE TO PROBABLY

694
00:29:41,567 --> 00:29:43,334
A MILLION AND A HALF,
2 MILLION VOTERS?

695
00:29:43,334 --> 00:29:44,400
YES.

696
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,968
BUT THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GONNA

697
00:29:45,968 --> 00:29:51,400
REACH OUT AND TOUCH 12.4,
12.5 MILLION VOTERS

698
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,467
IS ON THE TELEVISION,
INTO FOLKS' LIVING ROOMS,

699
00:29:53,467 --> 00:29:55,968
TO SOME DEGREE
ON THE INTERNET.

700
00:29:55,968 --> 00:29:57,968
THAT'S IT.

701
00:29:57,968 --> 00:29:59,501
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
WE GET TO THOSE FOLKS.

702
00:29:59,501 --> 00:30:01,200
SO THAT'S HOW
WE HAVE TO DO IT.

703
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,000
THIS IS CALIFORNIA.

704
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,434
WE GOTTA WIN THIS FIGHT.

705
00:30:04,434 --> 00:30:06,000
WE GOTTA GO UP
ON THE TELEVISION.

706
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,601
THAT'S HOW WE'RE GONNA DO IT.

707
00:30:08,601 --> 00:30:14,601
FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING
IN THE LAST 57 DAYS--

708
00:30:14,601 --> 00:30:17,167
AND THAT'S THE WAY
I WOULD CHARACTERIZE THAT 20%.

709
00:30:17,167 --> 00:30:19,434
THESE ARE FOLKS THAT
THIS IS NOT AN EASY DECISION.

710
00:30:19,434 --> 00:30:22,200
THEY DON'T NECESSARILY SUPPORT
GAY MARRIAGE.

711
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,834
IN FACT, MOST OF THAT UNDECIDED
PROBABLY DON'T.

712
00:30:24,834 --> 00:30:27,133
THEY DON'T NECESSARILY
OPPOSE IT.

713
00:30:27,133 --> 00:30:28,968
MIGHT BE A LITTLE
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH IT.

714
00:30:28,968 --> 00:30:31,400
BUT WHAT THEY NEED
TO BE--UNDERSTAND IS

715
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,467
THEY DON'T NEED
TO BE COMFORTABLE.

716
00:30:33,467 --> 00:30:36,667
THEY JUST NEED TO SAY,
"I DON'T NEED TO BE COMFORTABLE.

717
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:39,767
"THOSE PEOPLE--
WE HAVE A RIGHT.

718
00:30:39,767 --> 00:30:43,667
EVERYONE HAS A RIGHT TO MARRY
THE PERSON THEY LOVE."

719
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:44,968
THAT SIMPLE.

720
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:46,334
THAT'S WHAT THEY HAVE
TO GET COMFORTABLE WITH.

721
00:30:46,334 --> 00:30:48,467
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA
COMMUNICATE TO THEM.

722
00:30:48,467 --> 00:30:50,834
WE HAVE TO COMMUNICATE
ON THEIR LANGUAGE--

723
00:30:50,834 --> 00:30:54,100
WITH THEIR LANGUAGE.

724
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,167
STARTING FROM WHERE
THEY COME FROM

725
00:30:56,167 --> 00:30:58,000
AND BRING 'EM HOME
TO A "NO" VOTE.

726
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,567
ABSOLUTELY DOABLE.

727
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:01,334
WE'RE GONNA GO UP
ON THE TELEVISION.

728
00:31:01,334 --> 00:31:03,100
WE'RE GONNA GO UP
ON THE TELEVISION

729
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,801
THE FIRST WEEK IN OCTOBER.

730
00:31:04,801 --> 00:31:07,300
THE REAL QUESTION IS
ARE WE GONNA GET TO GO UP

731
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,934
ON THE TELEVISION EARLIER?

732
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:13,100
BECAUSE WHOEVER GETS UP
ON THE TELEVISION FIRST

733
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:16,234
WILL PROBABLY
WIN THIS CAMPAIGN.

734
00:31:16,234 --> 00:31:18,300
SOME FUNNY THINGS I--

735
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,501
IT'S BEEN MENTIONED
SEVERAL TIMES HERE.

736
00:31:19,501 --> 00:31:20,868
I'VE DONE MORE CAMPAIGNS THAN,
FRANKLY,

737
00:31:20,868 --> 00:31:22,267
I WANNA THINK ABOUT.

738
00:31:22,267 --> 00:31:24,934
YES, I AM AS OLD AS I LOOK.

739
00:31:24,934 --> 00:31:27,100
[chuckling]

740
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,534
MOST OF IT HAS BEEN TAKEN OUT
OF ME IN CAMPAIGNS.

741
00:31:29,534 --> 00:31:31,601
ALMOST EVERY TIME
ONE SIDE

742
00:31:31,601 --> 00:31:34,234
OR THE OTHER GETS UP--
IT CAN ONLY BE A MATTER

743
00:31:34,234 --> 00:31:35,634
OF A FEW DAYS,
IT COULD BE A WEEK--

744
00:31:35,634 --> 00:31:38,534
AND THEY ESSENTIALLY PUT OUT
AN AD THAT DEFINES THE RACE,

745
00:31:38,534 --> 00:31:39,767
GUESS WHAT?

746
00:31:39,767 --> 00:31:42,400
IF THEY GO UP,
GOD KNOWS HOW

747
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,901
THEY'LL DEFINE
THE RACE ACTUALLY.

748
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:45,934
LATELY WE'VE HEARD
ABOUT BIGAMY.

749
00:31:45,934 --> 00:31:47,801
WE'VE HEARD ABOUT,
"ARE WE GOING TO TEACH

750
00:31:47,801 --> 00:31:49,834
OUR KIDS IN KINDERGARTEN?"

751
00:31:49,834 --> 00:31:51,834
WE'VE HEARD,
"OH, DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIP.

752
00:31:51,834 --> 00:31:53,667
YOU DON'T NEED THIS."

753
00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:55,801
WE'VE HEARD A BUNCH OF STUFF
THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO

754
00:31:55,801 --> 00:31:58,133
WITH, "SHOULD PEOPLE
BE ALLOWED TO MARRY

755
00:31:58,133 --> 00:32:01,167
THE PERSON THEY LOVE?"

756
00:32:01,167 --> 00:32:04,200
IF WE GO UP,
WHAT ARE WE GONNA TALK ABOUT?

757
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,367
WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT,
"SHOULD PEOPLE BE ALLOWED

758
00:32:07,367 --> 00:32:09,467
TO MARRY THE PERSON THEY LOVE?"

759
00:32:09,467 --> 00:32:12,934
WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT,
"DON'T ELIMINATE THOSE PEOPLE'S

760
00:32:12,934 --> 00:32:14,868
"RIGHTS TO GET MARRIED.

761
00:32:14,868 --> 00:32:16,701
DON'T TREAT THEM DIFFERENTLY."

762
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:18,400
THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT.

763
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,100
THAT IS WHAT'S
ON THE BALLOT.

764
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,868
THAT'S THE DECISION.

765
00:32:23,868 --> 00:32:25,267
THE OTHER SIDE GETS UP FIRST
AND MAKES THIS ABOUT

766
00:32:25,267 --> 00:32:27,334
ALL SORTS OF OTHER STUFF?

767
00:32:27,334 --> 00:32:30,067
I'M GONNA END UP, AND THE WHOLE
COALITION IS GONNA END UP,

768
00:32:30,067 --> 00:32:32,300
SPENDING TWO OR THREE WEEKS
TRYING TO STRAIGHTEN OUT

769
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,400
IN PEOPLE'S HEADS
WHAT THIS CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT.

770
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,934
WE DON'T HAVE THE TIME
TO DO THAT.

771
00:32:35,934 --> 00:32:38,801
WE NEED TO JUST GO
AND MAKE OUR CASE,

772
00:32:38,801 --> 00:32:41,100
TELL 'EM WHAT IT'S ABOUT,
AND THEN--

773
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,667
THIS IS CALIFORNIA.

774
00:32:42,667 --> 00:32:44,434
PEOPLE DO BELIEVE IN FREEDOM.

775
00:32:44,434 --> 00:32:46,400
THEY DO BELIEVE
IN OTHER PEOPLE'S RIGHTS.

776
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,033
AND WE'LL WIN THIS RACE.

777
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:51,601
BUT WE ONLY DO IT
IF WE GET UP THERE FIRST

778
00:32:51,601 --> 00:32:52,834
AND TELL 'EM, YOU KNOW,
"THIS IS IT.

779
00:32:52,834 --> 00:32:54,267
"DON'T BELIEVE ALL THE CRAP,
FRANKLY,

780
00:32:54,267 --> 00:32:55,567
COMING FROM THE OTHER SIDE."

781
00:32:55,567 --> 00:32:56,734
THANK YOU.

782
00:32:56,734 --> 00:32:59,300
MORE THAN WILLING
TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.

783
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,267
LaJeunesse: PLEASE JOIN ME
IN THANKING OUR PANELISTS.

784
00:33:01,267 --> 00:33:04,200
[applause]

785
00:33:06,968 --> 00:33:09,367
ALL RIGHT,
SO THE MICS ARE OPEN.

786
00:33:09,367 --> 00:33:11,734
IF ANY OF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS,
PLEASE JUST GO

787
00:33:11,734 --> 00:33:14,100
TO ONE OF THE MICS AND THEN
FOR THE SATELLITE OFFICES

788
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,434
WHO ARE JOINING US BY V.C.,
WE'LL ALSO

789
00:33:17,434 --> 00:33:18,467
BE TAKING YOUR QUESTIONS.

790
00:33:18,467 --> 00:33:19,567
WE'LL JUST TAKE A COUPLE

791
00:33:19,567 --> 00:33:21,267
FROM THE LIVE AUDIENCE
FIRST.

792
00:33:21,267 --> 00:33:24,734
man: HI. I WANNA THANK YOU
FOR ALL BEING HERE.

793
00:33:24,734 --> 00:33:26,133
I'VE MET SEVERAL
OF YOU BEFORE.

794
00:33:26,133 --> 00:33:29,300
I KNOW YOU'RE DOING
INCREDIBLE WORK.

795
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:32,367
I AM GETTING MARRIED
TO MY SAME-SEX PARTNER

796
00:33:32,367 --> 00:33:35,901
IN A WEEK AND HALF, AND I WOULD
RATHER NOT HAVE TO DEAL

797
00:33:35,901 --> 00:33:38,834
WITH LEGAL CONFUSIONS
COME POST-NOVEMBER.

798
00:33:38,834 --> 00:33:41,000
AND WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT
TO ME AFTER 25 YEARS

799
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,467
OF BEING WITH THIS MAN,
IS THAT NOBODY ELSE

800
00:33:43,467 --> 00:33:45,634
HAS TO WAIT 25 YEARS
BEFORE THEIR STATE

801
00:33:45,634 --> 00:33:48,467
CATCHES UP WITH THEM.

802
00:33:48,467 --> 00:33:50,634
I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS,
IF I MAY.

803
00:33:50,634 --> 00:33:53,434
ONE IS...

804
00:33:53,434 --> 00:33:57,601
WHEN TALKING TO CORPORATIONS,
HOW DO YOU MAKE

805
00:33:57,601 --> 00:34:00,000
WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY HAS
TO BE A BUSINESS CASE

806
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,067
THAT THEY SHOULD
OPPOSE PROPOSITION 8

807
00:34:04,067 --> 00:34:09,434
AND THAT THEY SHOULD LAY OUT
CASH TO DO IT?

808
00:34:09,434 --> 00:34:11,267
Kendell: WELL, I THINK
ONE THING THAT'S GOOD

809
00:34:11,267 --> 00:34:14,634
ABOUT BEING IN A STATE
LIKE CALIFORNIA

810
00:34:14,634 --> 00:34:17,501
IS THAT THE FIRST PART OF THAT
IS A PRETTY EASY CASE TO MAKE.

811
00:34:17,501 --> 00:34:22,601
WE LIVE IN A STATE WHERE--
IN A COUNTRY, ACTUALLY--

812
00:34:22,601 --> 00:34:25,234
WHERE THE VAST MAJORITY
OF FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES

813
00:34:25,234 --> 00:34:27,634
HAVE NON-DISCRIMINATION
POLICIES,

814
00:34:27,634 --> 00:34:30,701
HAVE LGBT EMPLOYEE GROUPS
AND BENNET HEADS THE ONE

815
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:31,834
HERE AT GOOGLE.

816
00:34:31,834 --> 00:34:33,534
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN,
BENNET.

817
00:34:33,534 --> 00:34:36,267
AND IT'S JUST A PART
OF THE WORKFORCE,

818
00:34:36,267 --> 00:34:38,834
AND IT'S A PART OF RETAINING
THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST.

819
00:34:38,834 --> 00:34:40,634
NOT SAYING THAT LESBIAN
AND GAY PEOPLE

820
00:34:40,634 --> 00:34:44,467
ARE SMARTER THAN MOST PEOPLE,
BUT WE'RE A PART OF THE POOL

821
00:34:44,467 --> 00:34:47,334
OF PEOPLE THAT YOU WANT
TO RETAIN.

822
00:34:47,334 --> 00:34:52,300
AND IT'S A PART OF GOOD BUSINESS
TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU--

823
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,801
THERE'S NO BARRIER
TO THE BEST EMPLOYEE

824
00:34:55,801 --> 00:34:57,901
WANTING TO COME WORK FOR YOU.

825
00:34:57,901 --> 00:35:00,801
SO THAT'S A PRETTY EASY CASE
TO MAKE IN CALIFORNIA,

826
00:35:00,801 --> 00:35:02,400
AND BUSINESSES GET THAT.

827
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,300
THE SECOND PIECE
IS A LITTLE BIT HARDER,

828
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,968
BUT THIS IS WHAT WE'RE FINDING.

829
00:35:05,968 --> 00:35:09,467
AND WITH PG&E,
AND LEVI AND STRAUSS COMPANY,

830
00:35:09,467 --> 00:35:14,467
AND AT&T SUPPORTING "NO"
ON PROP 8 AND GIVING MONEY,

831
00:35:14,467 --> 00:35:17,534
WHAT THEY'RE RECOGNIZING
IS WE'RE PAST THE TIME

832
00:35:17,534 --> 00:35:20,534
IN CALIFORNIA WHERE
IT'S ENOUGH TO SAY--

833
00:35:20,534 --> 00:35:22,667
TO RETAIN THE BEST
AND THE BRIGHTEST,

834
00:35:22,667 --> 00:35:24,667
WE HAVE NON-DISCRIMINATION
POLICIES.

835
00:35:24,667 --> 00:35:28,567
WE HAVE A LGBT GROUP.

836
00:35:28,567 --> 00:35:31,334
EVERYONE IS UNDERSTANDING
THIS IS THE FIGHT

837
00:35:31,334 --> 00:35:35,367
THAT DEFINES EXACTLY WHAT KIND
OF WORKPLACE YOU ARE

838
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:37,300
AND WHAT
THE BUSINESS COMMITMENT IS.

839
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,367
IT'S NOT ABOUT WORDS
ON A PAPER.

840
00:35:39,367 --> 00:35:41,400
IT'S NOT ABOUT
A CORPORATE EQUALITY INDEX

841
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,901
OF ANY ONE PARTICULAR
ORGANIZATION.

842
00:35:43,901 --> 00:35:47,734
IT IS ABOUT MAKING SURE
THAT PROP 8 IS DEFEATED.

843
00:35:47,734 --> 00:35:50,400
AND WE FOUND AS PEOPLE
HAVE BEEN TALKING TO LOTS

844
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,267
OF DIFFERENT CORPORATIONS
IN THE SILICON VALLEY

845
00:35:52,267 --> 00:35:54,701
AS PART OF OUR BUSINESS COUNSEL,
AND IF ANY OF YOU

846
00:35:54,701 --> 00:35:57,801
HAVE CONNECTIONS
TO CORPORATIONS--

847
00:35:57,801 --> 00:36:00,133
GOOGLE, OBVIOUSLY,
WOULD BE NUMBER ONE ON THAT,

848
00:36:00,133 --> 00:36:02,901
BUT OTHERS AS WELL,
YOU SHOULD TALK TO ME,

849
00:36:02,901 --> 00:36:04,801
AND I CAN PUT YOU IN TOUCH
WITH THE BUSINESS COUNSEL

850
00:36:04,801 --> 00:36:06,100
BECAUSE WE FOUND

851
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:09,133
THAT THAT MESSAGE WORKS,
AND THEN WHAT DO YOU THINK

852
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:10,834
IS THE OTHER
NUMBER ONE THING

853
00:36:10,834 --> 00:36:13,467
THAT GETS MONEY
FROM CORPORATIONS?

854
00:36:13,467 --> 00:36:18,334
MONEY THAT COMES
FROM THEIR COMPETITORS.

855
00:36:18,334 --> 00:36:24,334
SO IF GOOGLE JUMPS FIRST
PUBLICLY IN THE SILICON VALLEY,

856
00:36:24,334 --> 00:36:27,467
YOU GET THE HIT OF BEING FIRST,
AND THEN EVERYONE ELSE

857
00:36:27,467 --> 00:36:29,167
WILL COME ALONG.

858
00:36:29,167 --> 00:36:30,767
AND IF GOOGLE DOESN'T GO FIRST,
THAT'S FINE.

859
00:36:30,767 --> 00:36:35,200
SOMEBODY'S GOING FIRST, AND
THAT'S IN PROCESS RIGHT NOW.

860
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,267
BUT BOTH THOSE THINGS WE FIND
ARE REALLY EFFECTIVE.

861
00:36:38,267 --> 00:36:39,968
man: OKAY,
JUST AS A MINOR CORRECTION,

862
00:36:39,968 --> 00:36:43,901
I WOULD NEVER SAY I WAS HEAD
OF THE GAYGLERS GROUP.

863
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:46,133
WE HAVE A WHOLE STEERING
COMMITTEE AND EVERYTHING.

864
00:36:46,133 --> 00:36:48,133
I'M THE "COORDINATOR,"
WHICH SOUNDS VERY GAY,

865
00:36:48,133 --> 00:36:50,968
AND RIGHTLY SO, AND
IT'S A MUCH WEAKER POSITION,

866
00:36:50,968 --> 00:36:52,400
BELIEVE ME.

867
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,434
Kendell: WELL, THEY CALL ME
THE HEAD LESBIAN, SO I JUST--

868
00:36:54,434 --> 00:36:55,801
man: YEAH, OKAY.

869
00:36:55,801 --> 00:36:58,400
THE OTHER QUESTION
AND THIS IS THE THING

870
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,868
THAT FRUSTRATES
ME THE MOST

871
00:37:00,868 --> 00:37:03,100
AND THAT I'M
MOST SCARED OF, REALLY--

872
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,868
IS THAT THE ISSUE IS FRAMED,
AND NOT ONLY

873
00:37:05,868 --> 00:37:10,901
JUST BY OUR OPPONENTS,
AS GAYS VERSUS CHRISTIANS,

874
00:37:10,901 --> 00:37:14,167
GAYS VERSUS PEOPLE OF FAITH,
GAYS VERSUS FAMILIES.

875
00:37:14,167 --> 00:37:16,367
AND EVEN THE NEWSPAPERS
WILL CALL

876
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:18,067
DONALD WILDMON'S ORGANIZATION--

877
00:37:18,067 --> 00:37:19,701
I MEAN, IT'S GOT A NAME,

878
00:37:19,701 --> 00:37:21,133
AMERICAN FAMILY ASSOCIATION.

879
00:37:21,133 --> 00:37:22,901
THEY CAN USE THE NAME AS FAR
AS I'M CONCERNED.

880
00:37:22,901 --> 00:37:25,901
BUT THEY'LL ALSO CALL IT
A FAMILY ORGANIZATION.

881
00:37:25,901 --> 00:37:27,567
A CHRISTIAN ORGANIZATION.

882
00:37:27,567 --> 00:37:29,968
AND I KNOW ENOUGH FAMILIES
AND ENOUGH CHRISTIANS

883
00:37:29,968 --> 00:37:32,834
TO KNOW THAT WHAT THAT IS IS
REALLY AN ANTI-GAY ORGANIZATION

884
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:34,968
WITH A FUNNY NAME.

885
00:37:34,968 --> 00:37:40,634
UM, HOW--AND THAT FRAMING
SEEMS SO EMBEDDED

886
00:37:40,634 --> 00:37:44,434
IN ALL CONVERSATIONS
ABOUT THIS.

887
00:37:44,434 --> 00:37:48,701
THE WAY THE TELEVISION SHOWS
WILL INTRODUCE

888
00:37:48,701 --> 00:37:52,868
ONE GAY PERSON
AND ONE CHRISTIAN.

889
00:37:52,868 --> 00:37:58,033
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
TO SHIFT THAT?

890
00:37:58,033 --> 00:38:00,234
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S
THE WAY WE LOSE.

891
00:38:00,234 --> 00:38:01,834
Kendell: YEAH,
GOOD POINT.

892
00:38:01,834 --> 00:38:03,667
Guerriero: A COUPLE OF POINTS,
AND I'LL LET STEVE

893
00:38:03,667 --> 00:38:06,767
GET TO THE CORE OF THE MESSAGING
PIECE TO IT, IS ONE,

894
00:38:06,767 --> 00:38:08,567
WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE
WE'RE PROBABLY NOT GONNA CHANGE

895
00:38:08,567 --> 00:38:10,367
SOME OF THAT FRAMEWORK
WITHIN 60 DAYS,

896
00:38:10,367 --> 00:38:12,200
WHICH IS A TOUGH THING
TO SEE.

897
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,167
BUT WE CAN CHANGE
THE FRAMEWORK BY WHICH PEOPLE

898
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:17,300
LOOK AT CIVIL MARRIAGE
LICENSES.

899
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:21,734
AND SO, YES, WE CAN PUSH TO HAVE
REALLY SMART SPOKESPERSONS

900
00:38:21,734 --> 00:38:23,968
WHO CAN SPEAK
WITH A LEVEL OF RELIGIOSITY

901
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,601
ON THE NEWS AND IN NEWSPAPERS,
AND THAT'S GOING TO BE DONE.

902
00:38:26,601 --> 00:38:29,300
BUT WE ALSO AREN'T GONNA CHANGE
THIS GREATER FRAMEWORK

903
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:32,267
ALL THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA,
AND NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT,

904
00:38:32,267 --> 00:38:34,234
AS I THINK WAS
REALLY SMARTLY DONE

905
00:38:34,234 --> 00:38:36,100
ON THE DAY
OF THE FIRST MARRIAGES,

906
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,667
THAT THERE WAS
A WONDERFUL CELEBRATION,

907
00:38:38,667 --> 00:38:41,033
AND IT WAS BEAUTIFUL,
BUT IT WAS CLEARLY

908
00:38:41,033 --> 00:38:42,901
CIVIL MARRIAGE LICENSES.

909
00:38:42,901 --> 00:38:45,701
PEOPLE WALKING INTO CITY HALLS
AND TOWN HALLS

910
00:38:45,701 --> 00:38:48,200
GETTING A PIECE OF PAPER
AND RECOGNIZING THEIR

911
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,133
SOMETIMES HALF
A CENTURY RELATIONSHIP.

912
00:38:51,133 --> 00:38:54,467
AND SO IT DIFFUSES
THAT SWING-VOTER'S SENSE OF,

913
00:38:54,467 --> 00:38:57,133
"IS THIS ABOUT
MY OWN MARRIAGE OR NOT?"

914
00:38:57,133 --> 00:39:00,400
BECAUSE THIS IS SUCH
A TIGHT TIMELINE.

915
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,634
WHAT WE'VE FOUND JUST
IN ONE OTHER STATE

916
00:39:02,634 --> 00:39:04,901
WHERE WE'VE HAD
SOME EXPERIENCE WITH THIS

917
00:39:04,901 --> 00:39:07,267
IS THAT WHEN THE PUBLIC SAW
INDIVIDUALS ASKING

918
00:39:07,267 --> 00:39:09,567
FOR A PIECE OF PAPER,
A LICENSE TO RECOGNIZE

919
00:39:09,567 --> 00:39:11,501
THEIR RELATIONSHIP
IN MASSACHUSETTS,

920
00:39:11,501 --> 00:39:16,000
THAT SWING VOTER ENDED UP MOVING
JUST SLIGHTLY TO OUR SIDE,

921
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,033
WHICH IS WHY STEVE'S POINT
ABOUT FRAMING THIS ARGUMENT

922
00:39:18,033 --> 00:39:19,501
REALLY FAST
IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS

923
00:39:19,501 --> 00:39:23,033
ABOUT THAT VERSUS
THE QUESTIONS THAT OTHERS

924
00:39:23,033 --> 00:39:26,334
WOULD WANNA PROPOSE,
I THINK IS THE CRITICAL

925
00:39:26,334 --> 00:39:28,234
LYNCHPIN TO WINNING.

926
00:39:28,234 --> 00:39:29,634
Smith: GOOD NEWS
AND BAD NEWS HERE.

927
00:39:29,634 --> 00:39:32,534
THE GOOD NEWS IS--THIS IS
GONNA SOUND REALLY FUNNY--

928
00:39:32,534 --> 00:39:35,701
THAT THE FUNDAMENTALIST CHURCHES
ARE GONNA PUT 40,000--

929
00:39:35,701 --> 00:39:37,234
THEY'RE GONNA TRY

930
00:39:37,234 --> 00:39:40,334
TO PUT 40,000 PEOPLE
IN QUALCOMM STADIUM

931
00:39:40,334 --> 00:39:44,767
FOR A PRAYER VIGIL ON THE SUNDAY
BEFORE THE ELECTION.

932
00:39:44,767 --> 00:39:47,734
I KNOW IT SOUNDS FUNNY
I'M SAYING IT'S GOOD NEWS.

933
00:39:47,734 --> 00:39:50,133
FOR UNDECIDED VOTERS
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA,

934
00:39:50,133 --> 00:39:54,067
THEY ARE A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE
WITH THAT NOTION, FRANKLY.

935
00:39:54,067 --> 00:39:56,701
SO WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO
IS LEADING UP TO THAT,

936
00:39:56,701 --> 00:40:00,400
WE'RE GONNA TAKE SOME RECOGNIZED
RELIGIOUS LEADERS IN THIS STATE

937
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,234
AND HAVE THEM IN QUIET TONES,
NOT SORT OF THREATENING

938
00:40:05,234 --> 00:40:09,767
AND RHETORICAL AND ALL THAT,
TALK ABOUT...

939
00:40:09,767 --> 00:40:11,868
WHAT'S REAL.

940
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:15,434
THAT, IN FACT, LOVE, COMMITMENT,
MARRIAGE,

941
00:40:15,434 --> 00:40:21,100
FAMILIES IS NOT EXCLUSIVE
TO STRAIGHT CALIFORNIANS.

942
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:24,033
AND THAT'S GONNA CUT
ON THAT ISSUE, AND I THINK

943
00:40:24,033 --> 00:40:26,534
IT PROBABLY WORKS REAL WELL
WITH THEIR BASE

944
00:40:26,534 --> 00:40:28,434
THAT THE FOLKS COULD
GET REALLY EXCITED,

945
00:40:28,434 --> 00:40:31,267
BECAUSE THAT'S JUST
WHO THEY ARE.

946
00:40:31,267 --> 00:40:34,834
I THINK FOR "UNDECIDED,"
FOR THAT 20% IN THE MIDDLE,

947
00:40:34,834 --> 00:40:36,234
THAT'S GONNA END UP CUTTING
OUR WAY SLIGHTLY

948
00:40:36,234 --> 00:40:37,701
IF WE HANDLE IT WELL.

949
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:38,934
Guerriero: AND ONE QUICK
FOOTNOTE.

950
00:40:38,934 --> 00:40:42,901
IF EVERY SINGLE LGBT PERSON
IN THIS STATE,

951
00:40:42,901 --> 00:40:45,033
AND OUR FRIENDS,
AND FAMILY, AND ALLIES,

952
00:40:45,033 --> 00:40:48,801
JUST SENT TO THEIR
EMAIL UNIVERSE A STATEMENT,

953
00:40:48,801 --> 00:40:51,901
"MY FAMILY IS ON THE BALLOT
THIS NOVEMBER,"

954
00:40:51,901 --> 00:40:53,667
THAT ALONE COULD BE WORTH
A COUPLE POINTS

955
00:40:53,667 --> 00:40:55,601
THAT DETERMINE WINNING
AND LOSING.

956
00:40:55,601 --> 00:40:58,100
AND WE DISCOVERED ON
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COUNTRY

957
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:01,467
THAT SOME OF THE MOST
PASSIONATE LGBT ACTIVISTS

958
00:41:01,467 --> 00:41:04,033
NEVER ASKED THEIR OWN FAMILY
FOR A VOTE.

959
00:41:04,033 --> 00:41:06,367
AND LET'S NOT MAKE THAT MISTAKE
HERE IN CALIFORNIA

960
00:41:06,367 --> 00:41:07,801
'CAUSE THAT COULD ACTUALLY BE

961
00:41:07,801 --> 00:41:12,267
THE DIFFERENCE ON TOP
OF THE ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN.

962
00:41:12,267 --> 00:41:14,467
man: SO LET ME START
BY MENTIONING AN ANECDOTE.

963
00:41:14,467 --> 00:41:17,000
A FRIEND OF MINE WAS DOING
SOME CANVASSING IN PALO ALTO,

964
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,234
AND HE SAID THERE WERE MULTIPLE
PEOPLE HE RAN INTO

965
00:41:20,234 --> 00:41:23,267
WHO SAID, "OH, YES, I SUPPORT
GAY PEOPLE TO MARRIAGE.

966
00:41:23,267 --> 00:41:25,367
I'M GONNA VOTE 'YES' ON 8."

967
00:41:25,367 --> 00:41:26,801
[chuckling]

968
00:41:26,801 --> 00:41:28,501
HE WAS LIKE,
"UNGH! STOP!"

969
00:41:28,501 --> 00:41:31,868
SO, I MEAN, THAT--
OBVIOUSLY, YOU GUYS KNOW

970
00:41:31,868 --> 00:41:33,067
HOW TO HANDLE THAT ONE.

971
00:41:33,067 --> 00:41:34,667
I JUST THOUGHT I'D MENTION
THE ANECDOTE

972
00:41:34,667 --> 00:41:36,868
THAT EVEN JUST LAST WEEKEND
HE WAS STILL GETTING THAT.

973
00:41:36,868 --> 00:41:39,467
IT'S A PROBLEM.

974
00:41:39,467 --> 00:41:44,434
BUT MY QUESTION IS--
SO I'VE ALREADY GIVEN MORE--

975
00:41:44,434 --> 00:41:47,033
ACTUALLY TEN TIMES MORE MONEY
TO THIS CAMPAIGN

976
00:41:47,033 --> 00:41:49,267
THAN I'VE EVER GIVEN
TO ANY OTHER POLITICAL THING.

977
00:41:49,267 --> 00:41:53,167
UM, WHAT ELSE CAN I DO?

978
00:41:53,167 --> 00:41:54,200
[laughter]

979
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,367
I MEAN,
IS THAT THE ONLY THING?

980
00:41:55,367 --> 00:41:56,534
Smith: NO.

981
00:41:56,534 --> 00:41:57,868
Kendell: NO, IT'S NOT
THE ONLY THING.

982
00:41:57,868 --> 00:42:00,100
AND LISTEN,
LET ME SAY FIRST OF ALL,

983
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,534
THANK YOU FOR GIVING,
AND IF EVERYONE GAVE

984
00:42:02,534 --> 00:42:04,534
TEN TIMES WHAT THEY'VE GIVEN
TO ANYTHING ELSE,

985
00:42:04,534 --> 00:42:06,267
WE WOULD WIN THIS THING.

986
00:42:06,267 --> 00:42:07,968
SO THAT IS A GREAT EXAMPLE.

987
00:42:07,968 --> 00:42:09,334
THANK YOU.

988
00:42:09,334 --> 00:42:11,501
THE OTHER THING YOU CAN DO.

989
00:42:11,501 --> 00:42:17,334
THERE ARE ACTION ITEMS
ON THE NOONPROP8.COM WEBSITE,

990
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:20,400
AND THE BIGGEST THINGS
THAT YOU CAN DO

991
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,267
ARE WHAT PATRICK ALLUDED TO.

992
00:42:22,267 --> 00:42:25,200
MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S NEVER
ANYONE WHO KNOWS YOU

993
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,167
THAT DOESN'T KNOW
THEY SHOULD VOTE NO.

994
00:42:28,167 --> 00:42:31,400
FROM YOUR DRY CLEANER,
THE MOST INCIDENTAL CONTACTS,

995
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,701
TO THE MOST
SUBSTANTIAL CONTACTS.

996
00:42:33,701 --> 00:42:37,000
WAKING UP EVERY DAY SAYING,
"WHO DO I TALK TO TODAY?

997
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
WHAT CAN I DO TODAY
TO DEFEAT PROP 8?"

998
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,133
LETTERS TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY.

999
00:42:44,133 --> 00:42:47,067
THERE'S A WHOLE
GOOGLE NETWORK OF FOLKS

1000
00:42:47,067 --> 00:42:49,701
THAT PROBABLY HAVEN'T GIVEN
AND DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THIS.

1001
00:42:49,701 --> 00:42:52,701
ASKING PEOPLE TO GIVE, WHICH
YOU MAY NOT HAVE DONE BEFORE.

1002
00:42:52,701 --> 00:42:56,133
WE CAN GIVE YOU TEMPLATES
FOR BEING ABLE TO DO THAT.

1003
00:42:56,133 --> 00:42:59,100
AND THEN ONE OF THE MOST
IMPORTANT PARTS OF THE CAMPAIGN,

1004
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:01,367
THE FIELD COMPONENT
OF THE CAMPAIGN.

1005
00:43:01,367 --> 00:43:03,534
AND THERE IS AN OFFICE
DOWN HERE

1006
00:43:03,534 --> 00:43:06,100
IN--I THINK IT'S IN SAN JOSE
IS THE FIELD OFFICE.

1007
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,667
BUT YOU CAN
ACTUALLY CONTACT ME DIRECTLY

1008
00:43:07,667 --> 00:43:11,968
AND I'LL PUT YOU IN TOUCH WITH
FOLKS TO DO SOME PHONE BANKING.

1009
00:43:11,968 --> 00:43:13,300
EVEN THOUGH--
WHAT YOU'RE PHONE BANKING--

1010
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,601
IS YOU'RE NOT DOING COLD CALLS.

1011
00:43:14,601 --> 00:43:15,834
AND I UNDERSTAND
PEOPLE ARE LIKE,

1012
00:43:15,834 --> 00:43:17,567
"OOH, I JUST DON'T WANNA CALL
STRANGERS."

1013
00:43:17,567 --> 00:43:20,100
BUT LET ME JUST SAY
TO STEVE'S EARLIER POINT,

1014
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,968
WE WILL WIN THIS WITHIN
THE MARGIN OF ERROR.

1015
00:43:22,968 --> 00:43:26,067
THAT MARGIN OF ERROR
COULD BE, YOU KNOW,

1016
00:43:26,067 --> 00:43:29,667
MICHAEL PHELPS' FINGERNAIL
IS WHAT WE SAY IN THE CAMPAIGN.

1017
00:43:29,667 --> 00:43:33,701
AND THAT COULD BE
THE 250,000 VOTERS

1018
00:43:33,701 --> 00:43:36,133
THAT WE ARE GOING TO CALL,
PHONE BANKING,

1019
00:43:36,133 --> 00:43:37,734
ASKING THEM TO VOTE NO.

1020
00:43:37,734 --> 00:43:39,601
GRAB A BUNCH OF YOUR FRIENDS.

1021
00:43:39,601 --> 00:43:41,400
GO OUT AND MAKE A NIGHT OF IT.

1022
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,033
TWO HOURS PHONE BANKING,

1023
00:43:43,033 --> 00:43:44,567
TAKE 'EM OUT
FOR A COUPLE OF PITCHERS,

1024
00:43:44,567 --> 00:43:47,968
AND YOU WILL HAVE DONE
AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT

1025
00:43:47,968 --> 00:43:50,767
IN ADDITION
TO THE OTHER LIST OF THINGS.

1026
00:43:50,767 --> 00:43:52,534
Guerriero: THE PITCHERS
BEFORE OR AFTER THE CALLS?

1027
00:43:52,534 --> 00:43:54,000
Kendell: WELL, YOU KNOW,
IT JUST DEPENDS.

1028
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,601
I'LL LEAVE IT UP TO YOU.

1029
00:43:55,601 --> 00:43:57,467
Smith: DO YOU GET BETTER?

1030
00:43:57,467 --> 00:43:59,267
LaJeunesse: ALL RIGHT,
WHY DON'T WE TAKE A QUESTION

1031
00:43:59,267 --> 00:44:03,033
FROM ONE OF THE SATELLITE
OFFICES, REMOTE OFFICES, BY--

1032
00:44:03,033 --> 00:44:05,334
IT'S AUDIO, RIGHT--
JUST AUDIO?

1033
00:44:05,334 --> 00:44:10,801
ANYONE OUT THERE HAVE
A QUESTION FOR OUR PANEL?

1034
00:44:10,801 --> 00:44:14,968
GOING ONCE, GOING TWICE.

1035
00:44:14,968 --> 00:44:16,901
man: CAN YOU CLARIFY TO PEOPLE
OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA

1036
00:44:16,901 --> 00:44:18,067
[man speaking indistinctly]

1037
00:44:18,067 --> 00:44:19,901
LaJeunesse: OKAY, DO YOU WANNA
MAKE THAT POINT?

1038
00:44:19,901 --> 00:44:21,133
Kendell: OH, YES.

1039
00:44:21,133 --> 00:44:22,601
NO MATTER WHERE YOU LIVE.

1040
00:44:22,601 --> 00:44:23,667
INTERNATIONALLY?

1041
00:44:23,667 --> 00:44:25,067
Smith: NO.

1042
00:44:25,067 --> 00:44:26,901
LaJeunesse: I'M SORRY,
THE QUESTION WAS TO CLARIFY

1043
00:44:26,901 --> 00:44:29,934
THAT REGARDLESS OF WHERE
YOU RESIDE, YOU ARE LEGALLY

1044
00:44:29,934 --> 00:44:31,400
ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE
TO THE CAMPAIGN.

1045
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,934
Kendell: YES, YOU HAVE TO BE
A CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES.

1046
00:44:34,934 --> 00:44:35,934
BUT--

1047
00:44:35,934 --> 00:44:36,968
man: OR GREEN CARDS.

1048
00:44:36,968 --> 00:44:38,400
OR GREEN CARD HOLDERS.

1049
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,100
Kendell: OR GREEN CARD HOLDER,
THANK YOU, YES.

1050
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,501
OR GREEN CARD HOLDER.

1051
00:44:41,501 --> 00:44:43,234
YOU ALL WOULD KNOW THAT,
WOULDN'T YOU?

1052
00:44:43,234 --> 00:44:44,868
YES.

1053
00:44:44,868 --> 00:44:47,667
AND YOU CAN GIVE MONEY
TO THE CAMPAIGN

1054
00:44:47,667 --> 00:44:50,901
EITHER THROUGH THE WEBSITE--
YOU CAN--

1055
00:44:50,901 --> 00:44:55,400
THERE'S A WAY TO GIVE THERE
OR CONTACT THE WEBSITE ABOUT--

1056
00:44:55,400 --> 00:45:00,133
THE CONTACT INFORMATION THERE
ABOUT WANTING TO MAKE A GIFT.

1057
00:45:00,133 --> 00:45:02,234
ABOVE THE THE $10 MILLION
THAT YOU SEE THERE

1058
00:45:02,234 --> 00:45:04,767
AND THE $32,000 THAT WE--
OR 32,000 DONORS

1059
00:45:04,767 --> 00:45:08,033
THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER,
A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE,

1060
00:45:08,033 --> 00:45:10,000
NOT A MAJORITY, OF COURSE,
BUT A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE

1061
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,734
IS FROM OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA
BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A STATE

1062
00:45:12,734 --> 00:45:15,267
THAT WON'T BE TOUCHED, AS
PATRICK TALKED ABOUT, BY THIS.

1063
00:45:15,267 --> 00:45:16,901
SO NO MATTER
WHERE PEOPLE LIVE--

1064
00:45:16,901 --> 00:45:19,734
SO IF YOU HAVE
WEALTHY FRIENDS OR FAMILY

1065
00:45:19,734 --> 00:45:22,033
OUTSIDE OF THE STATE
OF CALIFORNIA

1066
00:45:22,033 --> 00:45:25,601
WHO YOU THINK WOULD BE WILLING
TO MAKE A CONTRIBUTION,

1067
00:45:25,601 --> 00:45:27,567
WE WILL DO WHATEVER
WE NEED TO DO

1068
00:45:27,567 --> 00:45:29,634
AT THE CAMPAIGN TO HELP YOU
FACILITATE THAT.

1069
00:45:29,634 --> 00:45:31,567
WE WILL PROVIDE YOU
TALKING POINTS,

1070
00:45:31,567 --> 00:45:33,734
A SAMPLE LETTER,
WALK YOU THROUGH IT.

1071
00:45:33,734 --> 00:45:35,534
YOU KNOW, I'LL GET
ON THE PHONE MYSELF WITH 'EM

1072
00:45:35,534 --> 00:45:37,100
DEPENDING ON THE SIZE
OF THE GIFT.

1073
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:39,367
[laughter]

1074
00:45:39,367 --> 00:45:42,634
AND YOU CAN--FROM ANYWHERE
YOU LIVE YOU CAN GIVE.

1075
00:45:42,634 --> 00:45:45,200
YES, GOOD QUESTION.

1076
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,834
woman: I WANNA GO BACK TO THE
FRAMING AND MESSAGING DISCUSSION

1077
00:45:48,834 --> 00:45:50,968
ALTHOUGH STEVEN PARTLY
ADDRESSED, YOU KNOW,

1078
00:45:50,968 --> 00:45:52,667
WHAT I HAD AS A QUESTION.

1079
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:57,000
SO WHAT WE'VE HEARD HERE
IS IT'S NOT--

1080
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,834
FOR CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE
IN THE 20%,

1081
00:46:00,834 --> 00:46:02,934
YOU DON'T NEED TO FEEL
COMFORTABLE WITH IT,

1082
00:46:02,934 --> 00:46:04,367
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,
SOMEONE ELSE'S BUSINESS,

1083
00:46:04,367 --> 00:46:07,167
WHICH IS A GREAT PROGRESSIVE,
A GREAT, YOU KNOW,

1084
00:46:07,167 --> 00:46:10,234
LIBERTARIAN ARGUMENT,
BUT I'M CONCERNED HOW IT GETS

1085
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:12,534
TO THE CHRISTIAN BASE.

1086
00:46:12,534 --> 00:46:15,133
THEN WHAT WE'VE HEARD IS,
YOU KNOW,

1087
00:46:15,133 --> 00:46:17,100
SOMEONE'S FAMILY
IS ON THE LINE.

1088
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:19,801
WHICH IS ALSO A GREAT ARGUMENT,
BUT IT'S A LITTLE BIT

1089
00:46:19,801 --> 00:46:22,968
LIKE A "PETA" ARGUMENT IN THERE
IS SOME CONDESCENSION OF, LIKE,

1090
00:46:22,968 --> 00:46:28,901
THE STRAIGHT MAJORITY RELATING
TO THE LGBT MINORITY.

1091
00:46:28,901 --> 00:46:31,434
SO, AGAIN, I'M WONDERING
TO WHAT EXTENT IT GETS

1092
00:46:31,434 --> 00:46:33,167
TO THE CHRISTIAN BASE.

1093
00:46:33,167 --> 00:46:36,868
SO I'M THINKING THAT
WHAT I DON'T HEAR IS, LIKE,

1094
00:46:36,868 --> 00:46:39,734
REALLY POSITIVE, LIKE,
AFFIRMATIVE ARGUMENTS.

1095
00:46:39,734 --> 00:46:43,734
LET'S SAY BECAUSE
THE LGBT MINORITY WANTS TO JOIN

1096
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:48,300
AND IS JOINING IN THE
INSTITUTION OF MARRIAGE ITSELF,

1097
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:51,167
IT ACTUALLY AFFIRMS
THE MARRIAGES OF, YOU KNOW,

1098
00:46:51,167 --> 00:46:53,801
CHRISTIAN PEOPLE,
'CAUSE I'VE HEARD IN SOME STATES

1099
00:46:53,801 --> 00:46:57,000
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO, LIKE,
REMARRY BECAUSE THEY FEEL

1100
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,601
THAT, YOU KNOW,
GAY MARRIAGE HAS THREATENED

1101
00:46:59,601 --> 00:47:01,467
THEIR SACRED INSTITUTION
OF MARRIAGE AND, YOU KNOW,

1102
00:47:01,467 --> 00:47:03,000
ALL OF THAT STUFF.

1103
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,334
SO IT SEEMS THAT IT
CAN BE SWITCHED.

1104
00:47:05,334 --> 00:47:07,567
LIKE, THE ARGUMENT CAN BE
SWITCHED AND SAY,

1105
00:47:07,567 --> 00:47:10,767
"LOOK, YOUR INSTITUTION
OF MARRIAGE IS, YOU KNOW,

1106
00:47:10,767 --> 00:47:15,801
"REAFFIRMED BY VOTING NO
TO THE PROPOSITION.

1107
00:47:15,801 --> 00:47:18,234
"YOU'RE REAFFIRMING YOUR OWN,
BASICALLY, YOU KNOW,

1108
00:47:18,234 --> 00:47:20,033
CHRISTIAN, IF NEED,
THE INSTITUTION."

1109
00:47:20,033 --> 00:47:22,267
SO I JUST HAVEN'T HEARD THAT,
AND I'M WONDERING

1110
00:47:22,267 --> 00:47:25,901
IF THERE'LL BE ANYTHING.

1111
00:47:25,901 --> 00:47:28,334
Smith: WHAT--IF I WERE
TO GO DOWN THAT PATH,

1112
00:47:28,334 --> 00:47:30,167
THE WAY I WOULD
SAY THAT PRECISELY--

1113
00:47:30,167 --> 00:47:32,467
AND I GOTTA SAY WORDS
IN THIS THING MATTER A LOT.

1114
00:47:32,467 --> 00:47:34,100
woman: YEAH, YEAH,
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

1115
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:36,901
Smith: I WOULD SAY
DON'T LIMIT--

1116
00:47:36,901 --> 00:47:41,200
DON'T ELIMINATE OUR RIGHT
TO AFFIRM MARRIAGE.

1117
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,567
TO JOIN THE--I MEAN, WE--

1118
00:47:43,567 --> 00:47:46,033
GAY AND LESBIAN PEOPLE
WANNA STAND UP

1119
00:47:46,033 --> 00:47:49,100
AND SHARE
IN THE RESPONSIBILITY,

1120
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,868
THE COMMITMENT,
THE JOY OF MARRIAGE.

1121
00:47:51,868 --> 00:47:54,767
DON'T ELIMINATE
OUR RIGHT TO DO THAT.

1122
00:47:54,767 --> 00:47:56,801
SO I'D TAKE IT THAT ONE STEP.

1123
00:47:56,801 --> 00:47:58,834
YES, MAKE IT POSITIVE,
MAKE IT AFFIRMING,

1124
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:00,934
BUT THEN DO THE ELIMINATION
AT THE END

1125
00:48:00,934 --> 00:48:04,934
BECAUSE, IN FACT,
THAT'S WHAT MOTIVATES FOLKS.

1126
00:48:04,934 --> 00:48:09,400
woman: HAVE THERE BEEN STUDIES
ON--AS TO HOW WORDING CHANGES,

1127
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,801
LIKE, POLL RESULTS?

1128
00:48:10,801 --> 00:48:12,400
LIKE, WHAT IS THE DATA?

1129
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,467
Smith: LET ME GIVE YOU JUST
ONE LITTLE EXAMPLE,

1130
00:48:14,467 --> 00:48:17,133
AND IT'S A LITTLE OFF.

1131
00:48:17,133 --> 00:48:21,100
BUT IF--TO--
CLEARLY WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT

1132
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:23,968
TREATING PEOPLE DIFFERENTLY,
ANOTHER WAY TO SAY THAT

1133
00:48:23,968 --> 00:48:25,767
IS "DISCRIMINATE."

1134
00:48:25,767 --> 00:48:30,534
IF YOU USE "DISCRIMINATE,"
ABOUT 10, 15% OF THE PEOPLE

1135
00:48:30,534 --> 00:48:32,968
WON'T BUY IT AS WELL
AS IF YOU JUST SAY,

1136
00:48:32,968 --> 00:48:34,534
"TREAT PEOPLE DIFFERENTLY."

1137
00:48:34,534 --> 00:48:37,033
YOU GET A 10-15%
DIFFERENT REA--

1138
00:48:37,033 --> 00:48:38,901
THAT'S WHY THE WORD
"ELIMINATE" IS SO--

1139
00:48:38,901 --> 00:48:42,200
THE WORD "ELIMINATE"
IS PROBABLY WORTH TEN POINTS.

1140
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,400
JUST USING THAT WORD.

1141
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,501
SO THAT'S WHY I SAY
WHEN YOU MAKE

1142
00:48:45,501 --> 00:48:47,200
THE POSITIVE AFFIRMING,
"YEAH, WE WANT IT.

1143
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,567
"WE WANT THE RESPONSIBILITY.

1144
00:48:48,567 --> 00:48:50,534
WE WANT THE COMMITMENT."

1145
00:48:50,534 --> 00:48:52,667
DON'T ELIMINATE OUR RIGHT
TO DO THAT.

1146
00:48:52,667 --> 00:48:53,834
woman: OKAY.

1147
00:48:53,834 --> 00:48:55,968
LaJeunesse: AND RIGHT HERE.

1148
00:48:55,968 --> 00:48:57,934
man: I THINK YOU ACTUALLY JUST
ANSWERED MY QUESTION.

1149
00:48:57,934 --> 00:49:01,634
MY QUESTION WAS GOING TO BE,
IN OCTOBER WHEN YOU GO

1150
00:49:01,634 --> 00:49:04,834
ONTO THE AIRWAVES, ARE YOU GOING
TO BE PUTTING FORWARD

1151
00:49:04,834 --> 00:49:06,968
A POSITIVE MESSAGE SAYING,
YOU KNOW, "EQUALITY TO ALL,"

1152
00:49:06,968 --> 00:49:10,200
OR ARE YOU GOING TO BE SAYING,
"DON'T DESTROY OUR MARRIAGE"?

1153
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,234
Smith: WE'RE GONNA--IT'S A
POSITIVE MESSAGE TO SOME DEGREE.

1154
00:49:12,234 --> 00:49:14,033
BUT LET ME JUST SAY,
AND THIS GOES BACK TO--

1155
00:49:14,033 --> 00:49:15,701
I FORGET WHO IT WAS EARLIER
THAT SAID

1156
00:49:15,701 --> 00:49:18,234
THERE IS CONFUSION OUT THERE.

1157
00:49:18,234 --> 00:49:21,467
EVERY AD YOU SEE US DO
AT THE END WILL BE A NEGATIVE.

1158
00:49:21,467 --> 00:49:24,567
WE'RE LOOKING FOR A "NO,"
YOU KNOW?

1159
00:49:24,567 --> 00:49:26,901
VOTE NO ON 8.

1160
00:49:26,901 --> 00:49:30,300
WE CAN'T ALLOW ANY CONFUSION
ABOUT THAT AT THE END.

1161
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,634
LaJeunesse: STEVE, COULD YOU
JUST TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW

1162
00:49:32,634 --> 00:49:35,100
VOTERS WHO ARE UNDECIDED
AT THE LAST MINUTE

1163
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:37,033
GENERALLY GO TOWARD
THE "NO" ANYWAY, RIGHT?

1164
00:49:37,033 --> 00:49:38,501
Smith: YEAH.

1165
00:49:38,501 --> 00:49:40,100
LaJeunesse: IF THEY DON'T
UNDERSTAND IT,

1166
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:41,534
BUT THEY'RE NOT SURE,
IT GOES "NO," IS--

1167
00:49:41,534 --> 00:49:43,200
Smith: RIGHT, GENERALLY,

1168
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,200
IF YOU'RE PUSHING A "YES" VOTE
YOU HAVE A BIGGER BURDEN

1169
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,634
THAN IF YOU'RE PUSHING
A "NO" VOTE,

1170
00:49:46,634 --> 00:49:48,367
GENERALLY, IN MOST ELECTIONS.

1171
00:49:48,367 --> 00:49:51,767
SO IF FOLKS GO INTO A VOTING
BOOTH AND THEY'RE NOT SURE YET,

1172
00:49:51,767 --> 00:49:53,200
PEOPLE ARE KINDA, YOU KNOW--

1173
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,901
THEY GET NERVOUS
ABOUT CHANGE, FRANKLY.

1174
00:49:55,901 --> 00:49:57,434
SO IF THEY HAVEN'T REALLY
MADE UP THEIR MIND,

1175
00:49:57,434 --> 00:49:59,367
YOU'RE LIKELY
TO GET A "NO" VOTE.

1176
00:49:59,367 --> 00:50:01,701
THE ONE THING I WILL SAY THAT
MAKES THIS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

1177
00:50:01,701 --> 00:50:04,567
IS IN SOME PEOPLE'S HEADS,
WE'RE THE ONES

1178
00:50:04,567 --> 00:50:06,534
LOOKING FOR THE CHANGE NOW
BECAUSE MARRIAGE

1179
00:50:06,534 --> 00:50:08,133
IS RELATIVELY RECENT.

1180
00:50:08,133 --> 00:50:11,100
SO WE HAVE A SLIGHT TINGE
ON THAT,

1181
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:12,968
BUT WE STILL HAVE
TO DRIVE A, YOU KNOW,

1182
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:14,901
"VOTE NO ON 8."

1183
00:50:14,901 --> 00:50:16,701
AND AS YOU HAVE
ALL YOUR CONVERSATIONS--

1184
00:50:16,701 --> 00:50:21,234
AND I WANNA AGAIN SAY,
ONE ON ONES

1185
00:50:21,234 --> 00:50:23,334
PUTTING IT ON THE BASIS
TO YOUR FRIENDS OF,

1186
00:50:23,334 --> 00:50:25,868
"HEY, THIS VOTE IS ABOUT ME.

1187
00:50:25,868 --> 00:50:28,834
PROPOSITION 8,
YOU'RE VOTING ON ME."

1188
00:50:28,834 --> 00:50:30,400
YOU'RE GONNA PULL
SOME FRIENDS THAT WAY.

1189
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,534
THEY KNOW YOU.

1190
00:50:31,534 --> 00:50:32,601
Guerriero: SINCE I'M
THE LEAST--

1191
00:50:32,601 --> 00:50:33,868
man: "VOTE NO ON ME."

1192
00:50:33,868 --> 00:50:35,701
Guerriero: "VOTE NO
ON ME"?

1193
00:50:35,701 --> 00:50:36,767
THAT MIGHT WORK

1194
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:37,934
WITH SOME OF OUR ENEMIES.

1195
00:50:37,934 --> 00:50:39,534
Smith: THOSE ARE YOUR ENEMIES,
YEAH, RIGHT?

1196
00:50:39,534 --> 00:50:41,701
Guerriero: SINCE I'M THE LEAST
POLITICALLY CORRECT UP HERE,

1197
00:50:41,701 --> 00:50:45,734
I DO WANNA NOTE ONE THING
ABOUT THIS CAMPAIGN.

1198
00:50:45,734 --> 00:50:49,901
IS THAT IF I'M COMPLETELY
COMFORTABLE WITH THE AD

1199
00:50:49,901 --> 00:50:52,033
THAT STEVE PUTS UP
IN A FEW WEEKS,

1200
00:50:52,033 --> 00:50:54,067
WE'LL PROBABLY LOSE.

1201
00:50:54,067 --> 00:50:55,968
IF YOU'RE COMPLETELY COMFORTABLE
WITH THE AD YOU SEE,

1202
00:50:55,968 --> 00:50:58,267
AND IT MOVES YOU
IN A SPECIAL PLACE,

1203
00:50:58,267 --> 00:51:01,868
IT'S PROBABLY NOT THE RIGHT AD
TO MOVE THOSE PEOPLE.

1204
00:51:01,868 --> 00:51:05,033
AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE DO
ONCE WE ANALYZE A CAMPAIGN,

1205
00:51:05,033 --> 00:51:07,734
AND THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE,
AND THE DATA, AND THE POLLING,

1206
00:51:07,734 --> 00:51:10,667
AND RESEARCH,
AT SOME POINT, WE STEP BACK

1207
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:12,434
AND SAY, "HE KNOWS--

1208
00:51:12,434 --> 00:51:14,834
OR, "WE BELIEVE
HE IS TOTALLY CAPABLE

1209
00:51:14,834 --> 00:51:16,667
OF FIGURING OUT WHAT
THAT MESSAGE IS."

1210
00:51:16,667 --> 00:51:19,267
AND THERE WILL BE A LOT OF
MEMBERS OF THE LGBT COMMUNITY,

1211
00:51:19,267 --> 00:51:21,334
MAYBE EVEN
THE PROGRESSIVE COMMUNITY,

1212
00:51:21,334 --> 00:51:23,868
THAT DON'T LIKE THAT AD,
OR DON'T LIKE THE FACT

1213
00:51:23,868 --> 00:51:26,234
THAT THE AD MIGHT CHANGE
TEN DAYS LATER

1214
00:51:26,234 --> 00:51:28,267
DEPENDING ON WHAT
THE OTHER SIDE DOES.

1215
00:51:28,267 --> 00:51:31,801
AND FROM WHAT WE'VE SEEN
AROUND THE COUNTRY,

1216
00:51:31,801 --> 00:51:34,634
MOST OF THE TIMES
THE LGBT MOVEMENT

1217
00:51:34,634 --> 00:51:37,200
HAS NEVER BEEN ABLE TO PULL
BACK. AND ENDED UP

1218
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:40,234
MICROMANAGING THE MESSAGE,
AND CRITIQUING THE MESSAGE.

1219
00:51:40,234 --> 00:51:42,901
AND WE ENDED UP WITH A MESSAGE
THAT MADE US FEEL REALLY GOOD

1220
00:51:42,901 --> 00:51:46,334
AT NIGHT
UNTIL ELECTION NIGHT.

1221
00:51:46,334 --> 00:51:49,067
AND SO A BIG,
BOLD STEP FOR ALL OF US,

1222
00:51:49,067 --> 00:51:51,267
INCLUDING THOSE OF US WHO ARE
INVESTING BIG-TIME IN THIS,

1223
00:51:51,267 --> 00:51:54,901
IS TO COME TO A PLACE WHERE
WE JUST KIND OF EMBRACE THAT

1224
00:51:54,901 --> 00:51:56,634
AND ACCEPT STEPPING
OUT OF CONTROL,

1225
00:51:56,634 --> 00:51:59,634
TRUSTING THAT THERE'S
A REAL SMART TEAM IN PLACE.

1226
00:51:59,634 --> 00:52:01,300
SO THAT'S A TOUGH THING
FOR ALL OF US,

1227
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:03,133
AND I'M SURE ALL OF US
IN THE ROOM TODAY.

1228
00:52:03,133 --> 00:52:06,334
LaJeunesse: WHY DON'T WE SWITCH
OFF AND GO OVER HERE?

1229
00:52:06,334 --> 00:52:09,934
man: YOU ALMOST ANSWERED
MY SECOND QUESTION.

1230
00:52:09,934 --> 00:52:14,434
BUT THERE ARE REALLY TWO THINGS
THAT SCARE ME ABOUT THIS THING.

1231
00:52:14,434 --> 00:52:15,901
WHICH IS, NUMBER ONE,
WHAT I'M GONNA CALL

1232
00:52:15,901 --> 00:52:18,901
"THE DAVID DUKE EFFECT."

1233
00:52:18,901 --> 00:52:21,634
THAT, YOU KNOW, THE POLLS
MAY SHOW THEY'RE EQUAL,

1234
00:52:21,634 --> 00:52:24,901
BUT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LIE
AND TELL THE POLLSTERS

1235
00:52:24,901 --> 00:52:27,300
WHAT THEY THINK THE POLLSTERS
WANNA HEAR RATHER THAN

1236
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,634
WHAT THEY WANNA FEEL.

1237
00:52:29,634 --> 00:52:34,300
AND THE SECOND IS,
CAN THE GAY COMMUNITY

1238
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:36,868
REALLY MAKE HARD-HEADED
POLITICAL DECISIONS?

1239
00:52:36,868 --> 00:52:38,767
I KEEP ON THINKING
OF WHAT RECENTLY

1240
00:52:38,767 --> 00:52:42,334
HAPPENED WITH HRC AND ENDA,
WHERE HRC MADE

1241
00:52:42,334 --> 00:52:45,901
WHAT THEY THOUGHT WAS NOT THE
POLITICALLY CORRECT DECISION,

1242
00:52:45,901 --> 00:52:51,133
BUT THE POLITICALLY--
THE CORRECT POLITICAL DECISION,

1243
00:52:51,133 --> 00:52:55,167
AND THEY JUST GOT RAMMED
FOR IT.

1244
00:52:55,167 --> 00:53:00,267
YOU KNOW, EVERYONE
HATED THEM AS A RESULT, SO.

1245
00:53:00,267 --> 00:53:02,434
Guerriero: I'LL DEFEND YOU
FOR A SECOND HERE.

1246
00:53:02,434 --> 00:53:05,367
IN THE SENSE THAT THE GOOD
NEWS IS, UNLIKE THE HRC MODEL,

1247
00:53:05,367 --> 00:53:07,834
WHICH WAS A VERY DIFFICULT
EXPERIENCE FOR THE COMMUNITY,

1248
00:53:07,834 --> 00:53:09,834
AND DIVIDED REALLY
WELL INTENTIONED PEOPLE,

1249
00:53:09,834 --> 00:53:12,834
IS THAT TO THE CREDIT
OF KATE AND MANY OTHER

1250
00:53:12,834 --> 00:53:15,367
OF THE LEADERS IN CALIFORNIA,
THERE HAS BEEN

1251
00:53:15,367 --> 00:53:18,567
A TWO, THREE-YEAR PROCESS
OF GETTING TO A PLACE

1252
00:53:18,567 --> 00:53:20,067
WHERE WE KNEW THIS CAMPAIGN
WAS GONNA HAPPEN

1253
00:53:20,067 --> 00:53:21,701
AT SOME POINT.

1254
00:53:21,701 --> 00:53:24,767
AND LITERALLY, FROM THE LAST
YEAR AND A HALF,

1255
00:53:24,767 --> 00:53:26,601
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TOLD
THIS CAMPAIGN

1256
00:53:26,601 --> 00:53:29,100
MAY BE SOMETHING THAT YOU ARE
ULTIMATELY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH

1257
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:30,367
WHEN IT COMES TO EVERY
STRATEGIC DECISION.

1258
00:53:30,367 --> 00:53:33,601
AND SO, NO, THERE ISN'T
A HISTORY OF DOING IT.

1259
00:53:33,601 --> 00:53:35,367
THIS CAMPAIGN
AND THE COALITION GROUPS,

1260
00:53:35,367 --> 00:53:37,834
I THINK, HAVE A
VERY CLEAR UNDERSTANDING

1261
00:53:37,834 --> 00:53:39,434
THAT THAT'S GONNA BE THE CASE,

1262
00:53:39,434 --> 00:53:41,701
ESPECIALLY BETWEEN NOW
AND ELECTION DAY.

1263
00:53:41,701 --> 00:53:45,033
AND IF WE DON'T OVERCOME THAT,
WE WILL LOSE.

1264
00:53:45,033 --> 00:53:46,667
AND THAT'S, YOU KNOW,

1265
00:53:46,667 --> 00:53:48,467
IT'S A VERY
LEGITIMATE CONCERN.

1266
00:53:48,467 --> 00:53:50,234
Kendell: YEAH, AND I COULD
JUST SAY, I MEAN,

1267
00:53:50,234 --> 00:53:53,167
WE'RE ALREADY KNEE-DEEP
IN MESSAGING AT THIS POINT.

1268
00:53:53,167 --> 00:53:55,567
AND, YOU KNOW,
THE MESSAGING IS BASED ON

1269
00:53:55,567 --> 00:53:57,734
WHAT THE POLLS
AND THE FOCUS GROUP SAYS.

1270
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:59,934
IT'S NOT BASED ON THE AD
THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE,

1271
00:53:59,934 --> 00:54:03,467
YOU KNOW, AS A RADICAL,
LESBIAN FEMINIST,

1272
00:54:03,467 --> 00:54:05,567
YOU KNOW, UP ON THE TV.

1273
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:07,067
SO--AND WE ALL
UNDERSTAND THAT.

1274
00:54:07,067 --> 00:54:08,367
Smith: I'VE HEARD THAT
ABOUT YOU.

1275
00:54:08,367 --> 00:54:09,968
I'VE HEARD THAT
ABOUT YOU.

1276
00:54:09,968 --> 00:54:12,234
Kendell: AND WE REALLY HAVEN'T
HAD A DISAGREEMENT ABOUT THAT.

1277
00:54:12,234 --> 00:54:14,901
I WILL--I JUST HAVE TO NOTE,

1278
00:54:14,901 --> 00:54:18,000
BECAUSE I ACTUALLY
COMPLETELY DISAGREE

1279
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,834
ABOUT YOUR CHARACTERIZATION
ABOUT THE HRC THING.

1280
00:54:20,834 --> 00:54:22,868
AND IT'S NOT A POLITICAL CORRECT
OR NOT.

1281
00:54:22,868 --> 00:54:27,000
I THINK, STRATEGICALLY,
IT WAS A BAD DECISION.

1282
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,501
BUT I'M JUST SAYING THAT.

1283
00:54:28,501 --> 00:54:29,834
I DON'T WANNA
GET OFF POINT ABOUT IT,

1284
00:54:29,834 --> 00:54:31,234
BUT I JUST HAVE
TO BOOKMARK IT.

1285
00:54:31,234 --> 00:54:32,601
man: I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.

1286
00:54:32,601 --> 00:54:35,601
Kendell: BUT TO THE BIGGER ISSUE
THAT YOU'RE RAISING,

1287
00:54:35,601 --> 00:54:38,300
WE ARE COMPLETELY ON BOARD
WITH WINNING.

1288
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:41,601
I WANNA WAKE UP
NOVEMBER 5th KNOWING--

1289
00:54:41,601 --> 00:54:43,567
I MEAN, I'M GONNA WAKE UP
KNOWING THAT I DID

1290
00:54:43,567 --> 00:54:45,200
EVERYTHING I POSSIBLY COULD.

1291
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,234
THERE IS NOTHING MORE
I COULD HAVE DONE

1292
00:54:47,234 --> 00:54:49,033
TO DEFEAT PROP 8.

1293
00:54:49,033 --> 00:54:51,400
I DON'T WANNA BE
SECOND GUESSING ANYTHING

1294
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,767
THAT I DID OR MY LEVEL
OF COMMITMENT.

1295
00:54:53,767 --> 00:54:55,601
AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT
GONNA LOSE IT

1296
00:54:55,601 --> 00:54:59,701
BECAUSE I WAS WEDDED
TO MESSAGING THAT I LIKED

1297
00:54:59,701 --> 00:55:01,467
THAT WAS NOT DRIVEN
AND SUPPORTED

1298
00:55:01,467 --> 00:55:02,701
BY THE DATA.

1299
00:55:02,701 --> 00:55:04,234
Smith: AND LET ME
JUST FINISH OUT THE RESPONSE

1300
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:05,801
TO YOUR FIRST PART
OF YOUR QUESTION.

1301
00:55:05,801 --> 00:55:08,367
IF WE DON'T WALK IN THERE WITH
A 10-POINT LEAD IN THE POLLS,

1302
00:55:08,367 --> 00:55:09,367
WE'RE IN TROUBLE.

1303
00:55:09,367 --> 00:55:10,501
man: OKAY, THANK YOU.

1304
00:55:10,501 --> 00:55:12,601
Smith: I MEAN,
THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE.

1305
00:55:12,601 --> 00:55:14,267
woman: UM, MY QUESTION RELATES

1306
00:55:14,267 --> 00:55:17,167
TO THE LANGUAGE ABOUT
THE ECONOMIC EFFECTS

1307
00:55:17,167 --> 00:55:21,434
UPON THE STATE IF PROP 8 PASSES
OR DOESN'T PASS.

1308
00:55:21,434 --> 00:55:23,601
I NOTICED THAT THERE
IS SOMETHING RELATING

1309
00:55:23,601 --> 00:55:25,634
TO TOURISM REVENUE,
BUT THERE IS NOTHING

1310
00:55:25,634 --> 00:55:28,834
ABOUT THE EFFECT
OF LGBT WORKERS CHOOSING

1311
00:55:28,834 --> 00:55:30,501
TO COME TO THE STATE
OR TO LEAVE THE STATE

1312
00:55:30,501 --> 00:55:32,300
DEPENDING ON WHAT HAPPENS.

1313
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:34,400
HAS THERE BEEN ANY KIND
OF ANALYSIS DONE ON THIS,

1314
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,868
WHETHER IT BE BY THE STATE
OR BY "NO ON PROP 8"?

1315
00:55:37,868 --> 00:55:40,534
Guerriero: YEAH, I BELIEVE
THE WILLIAMS INSTITUTE AT UCLA

1316
00:55:40,534 --> 00:55:42,067
HAS DONE A STUDY
THAT SHOWS THAT FIGURE.

1317
00:55:42,067 --> 00:55:43,667
THEY WERE STILL
FINE-TUNING IT.

1318
00:55:43,667 --> 00:55:45,067
I HAVEN'T SEEN
THE ACTUAL FINAL REPORT,

1319
00:55:45,067 --> 00:55:46,767
BUT THAT IS ONE OF THE,
KIND OF,

1320
00:55:46,767 --> 00:55:49,701
MANY TALKING POINTS
THAT WILL BE CIRCULATED

1321
00:55:49,701 --> 00:55:51,667
BETWEEN NOW AND NOVEMBER,
AND IT'S THE WILLIAMS INSTITUTE,

1322
00:55:51,667 --> 00:55:53,200
THAT REALLY IS THE BEST
IN THE COUNTRY

1323
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,367
AT DOING THAT TYPE OF WORK
FOR THESE BALLOT INITIATIVES.

1324
00:55:56,367 --> 00:55:58,267
Kendell: WE DIDN'T HAVE
THE DATA IN TIME

1325
00:55:58,267 --> 00:56:00,834
FOR THE FISCAL ANALYST
LANGUAGE.

1326
00:56:00,834 --> 00:56:04,200
SO OTHERWISE IT WOULD SAY, LIKE,
YOU KNOW, A BILLION DOLLARS.

1327
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,567
AND, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH

1328
00:56:05,567 --> 00:56:07,534
TO, YOU KNOW,
DRIVE PEOPLE TO VOTE NO.

1329
00:56:07,534 --> 00:56:10,100
BUT IT'S A VERY
WELL TAKEN POINT.

1330
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:11,534
LaJeunesse: WE'RE AT RIGHT
ABOUT 4:00,

1331
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:13,501
AND I WANNA BE RESPECTFUL
OF THE PANELISTS' TIME,

1332
00:56:13,501 --> 00:56:16,033
BUT I THINK WE HAVE TIME
FOR ONE MORE QUESTION.

1333
00:56:16,033 --> 00:56:17,267
Kendell: YOU BET.

1334
00:56:17,267 --> 00:56:18,868
man: THANKS,
I JUST WANTED TO SAY

1335
00:56:18,868 --> 00:56:22,067
THAT MY WIFE AND I KNOW
FIVE LONG-TERM COUPLES

1336
00:56:22,067 --> 00:56:23,634
WHO'VE BEEN GETTING MARRIED
WITHIN, ABOUT,

1337
00:56:23,634 --> 00:56:26,734
A TWO-MONTH PERIOD HERE,
AND IN EACH CASE,

1338
00:56:26,734 --> 00:56:31,167
WE'VE BEEN DONATING
TO "NO ON 8" IN THEIR HONOR.

1339
00:56:31,167 --> 00:56:33,234
AS A WEDDING GIFT,
WE FIGURE THAT'S A LITTLE MORE

1340
00:56:33,234 --> 00:56:34,901
MEANINGFUL
THAN YET ANOTHER TOASTER OVEN.

1341
00:56:34,901 --> 00:56:37,868
[applause]

1342
00:56:37,868 --> 00:56:40,934
AND THAT THOSE FIVE COUPLES
INCLUDE, BY THE WAY,

1343
00:56:40,934 --> 00:56:43,601
OUR CURRENT PASTOR,
TWO FORMER PASTORS

1344
00:56:43,601 --> 00:56:47,033
AND THEIR PARTNERS,
AND I'D JUST LIKE TO SAY

1345
00:56:47,033 --> 00:56:50,100
I AND MY WIFE
CERTAINLY RESENT WILDMON

1346
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:52,000
AND THE REST
OF THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT

1347
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,167
TRYING TO MONOPOLIZE
THE NAME OF CHRISTIAN,

1348
00:56:54,167 --> 00:56:56,901
'CAUSE THEY
CERTAINLY DO NOT SPEAK FOR US.

1349
00:56:56,901 --> 00:56:58,267
SO, TWO QUESTIONS.

1350
00:56:58,267 --> 00:57:01,601
ONE IS WHAT CAN THE PROGRESSIVE
RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY DO

1351
00:57:01,601 --> 00:57:05,968
TO HELP DEFEAT PROPOSITION 8
ASIDE FROM, YOU KNOW,

1352
00:57:05,968 --> 00:57:07,467
WHAT WE'RE ALREADY DOING?

1353
00:57:07,467 --> 00:57:09,868
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S LIMITS
IN TERMS OF WHAT ONE CAN DO,

1354
00:57:09,868 --> 00:57:13,000
YOU KNOW, IN TERMS OF DIRECT
ACTION WITHIN THE CHURCH,

1355
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,200
BUT BY BEING LIKE-MINDED PEOPLE,
WE WANNA GET THAT MESSAGE OUT.

1356
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,067
AND THEN, ALSO,
I WAS HOPING THAT PATRICK

1357
00:57:19,067 --> 00:57:21,868
COULD SPEAK A LITTLE BIT MORE
TO THE HISTORY

1358
00:57:21,868 --> 00:57:23,834
IN MASSACHUSETTS,
AND HOW OPINIONS

1359
00:57:23,834 --> 00:57:26,467
HAVE TURNED AROUND THERE
JUST BY THE FACT

1360
00:57:26,467 --> 00:57:28,801
OF GAY MARRIAGE
BEING ESTABLISHED.

1361
00:57:28,801 --> 00:57:31,767
IT SEEMS, YOU KNOW,
FROM 3,000 MILES AWAY

1362
00:57:31,767 --> 00:57:34,667
THAT THAT REALLY HAS TURNED
A BUNCH OF PEOPLE'S OPINIONS

1363
00:57:34,667 --> 00:57:37,334
AROUND AND I'D LIKE TO HEAR
A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THAT.

1364
00:57:37,334 --> 00:57:39,167
Guerriero: SURE, I'LL MAYBE
CONNECT BOTH QUESTIONS

1365
00:57:39,167 --> 00:57:41,067
AND WRAP THEM INTO ONE,
WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST

1366
00:57:41,067 --> 00:57:42,567
POWERFUL THINGS THAT HAPPENED.

1367
00:57:42,567 --> 00:57:45,000
THAT EVERY TIME
THE RADICAL RIGHT

1368
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,367
WOULD GO ON TV,
OR HOLD A PRESS CONFERENCE,

1369
00:57:47,367 --> 00:57:49,767
OR ISSUE A PRESS RELEASE,

1370
00:57:49,767 --> 00:57:54,167
THE PROGRESSIVE RELIGIOUS
COMMUNITY CHOSE TO DO SOMETHING

1371
00:57:54,167 --> 00:57:56,434
THAT I THOUGHT WAS REALLY,
REALLY SMART.

1372
00:57:56,434 --> 00:57:58,601
THEY DIDN'T DECIDE
TO DEBATE THE BIBLE

1373
00:57:58,601 --> 00:58:01,434
OR THE INTERPRETATION
OF SCRIPTURE.

1374
00:58:01,434 --> 00:58:04,267
THEY CHOSE TO TALK ABOUT
HOW WE TREAT OUR NEIGHBORS.

1375
00:58:04,267 --> 00:58:09,534
ABOUT THEIR VIEW OF RELIGIOSITY,
ABOUT CHRISTIANITY,

1376
00:58:09,534 --> 00:58:11,367
AND THEY KINDA FLIPPED
THE ENTIRE ARGUMENT

1377
00:58:11,367 --> 00:58:13,100
COMPLETELY UPSIDE DOWN.

1378
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:15,100
AND IT WAS BEAUTIFULLY DONE,
BECAUSE THE WORK

1379
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:17,567
TO HAVE A HEAVY-DUTY,
MULTI-SYLLABIC,

1380
00:58:17,567 --> 00:58:20,434
RELIGIOUS DEBATE IS ONE
WE ULTIMATELY LOSE

1381
00:58:20,434 --> 00:58:22,734
IN A TIGHT TIMEFRAME
ABOUT A COMPLEX ISSUE

1382
00:58:22,734 --> 00:58:24,467
THAT PEOPLE ARE
STRUGGLING WITH.

1383
00:58:24,467 --> 00:58:26,501
BUT THEIR WILLINGNESS
TO STAND AT A MICROPHONE,

1384
00:58:26,501 --> 00:58:29,167
STAND PUBLICLY, SPEAK
AT PUBLIC HEARINGS AND SAY,

1385
00:58:29,167 --> 00:58:32,467
"I'M A MAN OR A WOMAN
WHO BELIEVES IN GOD

1386
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:34,300
"AND BELIEVES THAT MY NEIGHBOR
SHOULD BE TREATED

1387
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:38,534
ABSOLUTELY EQUALLY," UM,
WAS THE BEAUTIFUL COUNTERPOINT.

1388
00:58:38,534 --> 00:58:40,434
IT DIDN'T WIN
THE FAR-RIGHT VOTER.

1389
00:58:40,434 --> 00:58:42,968
IT DIDN'T, YOU KNOW,
GET TO THAT 40%

1390
00:58:42,968 --> 00:58:44,834
THAT AIN'T GONNA BE--
AREN'T GONNA BE WITH US.

1391
00:58:44,834 --> 00:58:47,434
BUT IT DID MOVE JUST
THAT SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE

1392
00:58:47,434 --> 00:58:50,567
THAT NEEDED TO STEP OUR WAY.

1393
00:58:50,567 --> 00:58:52,968
AND THEN THE LAST THING I DID--
THE ONLY NEGATIVE PART

1394
00:58:52,968 --> 00:58:54,501
ABOUT ALL THE MARRIAGES
IN MASSACHUSETTS

1395
00:58:54,501 --> 00:58:57,400
WAS THAT IT'S COST ME
SO MUCH MONEY IN WEDDING GIFTS

1396
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,834
OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS.

1397
00:58:58,834 --> 00:59:02,868
SO THE ECONOMIC IMPACT IS
ACTUALLY NEGATIVE INDIVIDUALLY.

1398
00:59:02,868 --> 00:59:04,534
YOU'VE DONE A REALLY--

1399
00:59:04,534 --> 00:59:06,100
PROBABLY THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
THING YOU CAN DO

1400
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:08,434
WHICH IS ENSURE THAT THE NEXT
GENERATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE

1401
00:59:08,434 --> 00:59:11,067
CAN NEVER--WON'T HAVE
TO QUESTION WHETHER THEY CAN

1402
00:59:11,067 --> 00:59:15,133
MARRY THE PERSON THAT THEY LOVE
AND THAT IS A GREAT ACT

1403
00:59:15,133 --> 00:59:18,167
OF CHRISTIANITY
AND I APPLAUD YOU FOR THAT.

1404
00:59:18,167 --> 00:59:21,000
AND WE, LIKE YOU,
HAVE REALIZED IN MASSACHUSETTS

1405
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,033
THAT ALL OF THE THREATS
OF THE FAR RIGHT

1406
00:59:24,033 --> 00:59:26,167
HAVE NOT COME TRUE.

1407
00:59:26,167 --> 00:59:28,901
AND THE PUBLIC,
WHICH USED TO BE 35%

1408
00:59:28,901 --> 00:59:30,501
SUPPORTING MARRIAGE EQUALITY,

1409
00:59:30,501 --> 00:59:32,701
MOVED UP TO 50
ONCE THE WEDDINGS HAPPENED.

1410
00:59:32,701 --> 00:59:35,667
MOVED UP TO 55,
AND NOW TWO OUT OF EVERY THREE,

1411
00:59:35,667 --> 00:59:37,734
INCLUDING THE MAJORITY
OF REPUBLICANS,

1412
00:59:37,734 --> 00:59:41,567
SUPPORT FULL MARRIAGE EQUALITY
FOR EVERYONE IN A STATE.

1413
00:59:41,567 --> 00:59:43,434
IT'S A PRETTY
AMAZING PLACE TO LIVE.

1414
00:59:43,434 --> 00:59:45,300
AND THIS GREAT STATE'S
GONNA BE THE NEXT ONE

1415
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:48,434
TO EXPERIENCE THAT MILESTONE.

1416
00:59:48,434 --> 00:59:50,033
LaJeunesse: DANIELLE,
DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION?

1417
00:59:50,033 --> 00:59:51,033
I SAW YOU BY THE MIC.

1418
00:59:51,033 --> 00:59:52,033
ARE YOU ALL SET?

1419
00:59:52,033 --> 00:59:54,000
JUST ONE LAST QUICK ONE.

1420
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,067
COME ON UP.

1421
00:59:56,067 --> 00:59:58,968
Danielle: HEY, THANK YOU.
I AM DANIELLE.

1422
00:59:58,968 --> 01:00:01,234
I WORK
IN THE EXECUTIVE OFFICE.

1423
01:00:01,234 --> 01:00:04,100
AND I AM ONE OF TEN KIDS.

1424
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,133
NUMBER THREE OUT OF TEN.

1425
01:00:06,133 --> 01:00:09,300
AND I WAS JUST
INSTANT MESSAGING MY DAD.

1426
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:12,868
MY DAD IS
A DIE-HARD REPUBLICAN CATHOLIC,

1427
01:00:12,868 --> 01:00:16,334
AND I WAS LIKE, "HEY, DAD,
I'M UP TO MISCHIEF."

1428
01:00:16,334 --> 01:00:18,334
AND HE ASKED ME
WHAT I WAS DOING.

1429
01:00:18,334 --> 01:00:22,801
AND I MENTIONED WHERE I WAS,
AND HIS QUESTION WAS,

1430
01:00:22,801 --> 01:00:25,801
"CAN'T YOU JUST CALL IT
SOMETHING ELSE?"

1431
01:00:25,801 --> 01:00:27,567
HE'S LIKE,
"IT'S NOT MARRIAGE.

1432
01:00:27,567 --> 01:00:29,067
CAN'T YOU JUST CALL IT
SOMETHING ELSE?"

1433
01:00:29,067 --> 01:00:32,701
SO I WANTED TO HAVE YOU GUYS
REALLY PINPOINT

1434
01:00:32,701 --> 01:00:35,601
WHAT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN
DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIPS

1435
01:00:35,601 --> 01:00:37,767
AND MARRIAGES ARE.

1436
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:41,100
I HAVEN'T--MY FAMILY
BEING VERY CATHOLIC--

1437
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:42,767
AND THEY'RE FROM PENNSYLVANIA,
SO I SAID,

1438
01:00:42,767 --> 01:00:45,167
"DAD, YOU'RE NOT REGISTERED
TO VOTE IN CALIFORNIA,

1439
01:00:45,167 --> 01:00:47,868
SO IT DOESN'T MATTER."

1440
01:00:47,868 --> 01:00:49,667
Kendell: BUT WE'LL HUMOR YOU
ANYWAY.

1441
01:00:49,667 --> 01:00:52,901
Danielle: YEAH, THANK YOU.

1442
01:00:52,901 --> 01:00:54,901
Kendell: I--IF I HAD A DOLLAR
FOR EVERY TIME I'VE BEEN ASKED

1443
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:58,200
THAT QUESTION, YOU KNOW,
I COULD FUND THE CAMPAIGN.

1444
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:02,367
AND WHAT I'VE TAKEN TO SAYING
WHEN PEOPLE ASK ME THAT QUESTION

1445
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:06,734
IS I SAY, "WHY?"

1446
01:01:06,734 --> 01:01:08,767
'CAUSE THINK ABOUT
WHAT ARE THEY ASKING?

1447
01:01:08,767 --> 01:01:12,767
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS THEY
THINK THERE'S SOMETHING SPECIAL

1448
01:01:12,767 --> 01:01:16,868
ABOUT MEN AND WOMEN'S
RELATIONSHIPS

1449
01:01:16,868 --> 01:01:21,334
THAT GAY AND LESBIAN COUPLES
DO NOT SHARE.

1450
01:01:21,334 --> 01:01:26,300
SO THE WORD "MARRIAGE"
SHOULD BE RESERVED

1451
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:29,934
FOR THOSE REAL RELATIONSHIPS.

1452
01:01:29,934 --> 01:01:31,767
THE MOST IMPORTANT
RELATIONSHIPS.

1453
01:01:31,767 --> 01:01:35,100
THE RELATIONSHIPS
THAT I UNDERSTAND THE MOST.

1454
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:37,467
'CAUSE I DON'T REALLY
GET THIS.

1455
01:01:37,467 --> 01:01:40,300
SO ONCE I HEAR
THE ANSWER BACK TO THE,

1456
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:44,634
"TELL ME WHY YOU WOULD LIKE IT
TO BE A DIFFERENT NAME?"

1457
01:01:44,634 --> 01:01:48,334
IT GENERALLY UNCOVERS
SOME LEVEL OF DISCOMFORT

1458
01:01:48,334 --> 01:01:51,968
WHICH PROVIDES
A PERFECT OPPORTUNITY

1459
01:01:51,968 --> 01:01:54,734
TO SAY, BECAUSE THEN
MY NEXT QUESTION IS,

1460
01:01:54,734 --> 01:01:57,167
"WELL, LET ME JUST
TURN THE TABLES.

1461
01:01:57,167 --> 01:01:59,400
"HOW ABOUT IF WE CALL
YOUR RELATIONSHIP

1462
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:02,133
"A CIVIL UNION
OR A DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIP

1463
01:02:02,133 --> 01:02:04,501
"AND MINE A MARRIAGE?

1464
01:02:04,501 --> 01:02:06,701
WOULD YOU GIVE UP
THE WORD 'MARRIAGE'?"

1465
01:02:06,701 --> 01:02:08,634
GIVE UP THE WORD "MARRIAGE"
FOR EVERYONE,

1466
01:02:08,634 --> 01:02:10,100
AND EVERYONE
HAS A CIVIL UNION.

1467
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:12,400
NOW, WHILE THAT MIGHT BE
SOME PEOPLE'S IDEA

1468
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,167
OF THAT'S A PERFECT SOLUTION
FOR THIS.

1469
01:02:14,167 --> 01:02:15,968
AND THEN IF YOU GET MARRIED IN
A CHURCH IT'S CALLED "MARRIAGE,"

1470
01:02:15,968 --> 01:02:18,367
THAT'S NOT WHERE WE ARE
IN THIS COUNTRY.

1471
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:23,634
MARRIAGE IS THE INSTITUTION
AND THE VOCABULARY

1472
01:02:23,634 --> 01:02:27,133
THAT WE USE TO DENOTE
THE HIGHEST LEVEL

1473
01:02:27,133 --> 01:02:29,667
OF A COMMITMENT
BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE.

1474
01:02:29,667 --> 01:02:32,667
IT IS WHAT WE DO.

1475
01:02:32,667 --> 01:02:37,467
AND AS LONG AS WE DO THAT,
GAY AND LESBIAN RELATIONSHIPS

1476
01:02:37,467 --> 01:02:39,567
SHOULD NOT BE EXCLUDED
FROM IT.

1477
01:02:39,567 --> 01:02:41,767
IT'S AS TERRY STEWART SAID
IN THE ARGUMENT

1478
01:02:41,767 --> 01:02:43,334
BEFORE THE CALIFORNIA
SUPREME COURT

1479
01:02:43,334 --> 01:02:45,534
WHEN SHE WAS ASKED
THIS VERY QUESTION.

1480
01:02:45,534 --> 01:02:48,434
WORDS MATTER.

1481
01:02:48,434 --> 01:02:52,167
THERE'S A REASON
WHY THIS LANGUAGE MATTERS

1482
01:02:52,167 --> 01:02:54,968
AND WHY YOUR DAD--
WHO SOUNDS LIKE A LOVELY PERSON,

1483
01:02:54,968 --> 01:02:58,167
SOUNDS JUST LIKE MY DAD,
WHO I LOVE--

1484
01:02:58,167 --> 01:03:00,267
WANTS TO ASK THAT.

1485
01:03:00,267 --> 01:03:03,133
BECAUSE HE WANTS IT
TO GO AWAY...

1486
01:03:03,133 --> 01:03:07,267
INSTEAD OF A CONTINUING
CONVERSATION THAT SAYS,

1487
01:03:07,267 --> 01:03:11,667
"THIS IS ABOUT US
AND OUR RELATIONSHIPS

1488
01:03:11,667 --> 01:03:14,801
BEING ABLE TO BE VALIDATED
IN THE SAME WAY."

1489
01:03:14,801 --> 01:03:17,000
NO DAD EVER SAID,

1490
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,868
"I CAN'T WAIT TO DANCE
AT MY DAUGHTER'S CIVIL UNION,

1491
01:03:19,868 --> 01:03:23,567
DOMESTIC PARTNER
COMMITMENT CEREMONY."

1492
01:03:23,567 --> 01:03:29,567
WE DANCE
AT OUR CHILDREN'S WEDDINGS.

01:03:29,567 --> 01:03:33,567
WE GET MARRIED.

1494
01:03:33,567 --> 01:03:36,601
AND AS LONG AS THAT
IS THE WAY WE MARK

1495
01:03:36,601 --> 01:03:40,801

AND COMMITMENT,

1496
01:03:40,801 --> 01:03:44,501
SAME-SEX COUPLES SHOULD HAVE
THAT SAME OPPORTUNITY.

01:03:44,501 --> 01:03:45,834
LaJeunesse: ALL RIGHT.
