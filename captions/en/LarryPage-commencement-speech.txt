00:00:11.890,00:00:13.540
Class of 2009! 

00:00:14.970,00:00:17.960
I don't think I heard you.
Class of 2009!

00:00:22.320,00:00:23.940
First I'd like you to stand up, 

00:00:24.760,00:00:27.770
wave and cheer your supportive 
family and friends! 

00:00:28.530,00:00:30.550
I'm sure you can find them out there.

00:00:32.650,00:00:33.950
Show your love!

00:00:46.560,00:00:49.190
It is a great honor for me 
to be here today.

00:00:50.080,00:00:51.110
Now wait a second. 

00:00:51.930,00:00:55.500
I know: that's such a cliche?
You're thinking: 

00:00:55.620,00:01:00.000
every graduation speaker says that 
-- It's a great honor. 

00:01:01.290,00:01:04.420
But, in my case, 
it really is so deeply true 

00:01:05.480,00:01:10.180
-- being here is more special and more
personal for me than most of you know.

00:01:11.600,00:01:13.360
I'd like to tell you why.

00:01:14.340,00:01:21.210
A long time ago, in this cold September 
of 1962, there was a Steven's co-op 

00:01:21.450,00:01:23.260
at this very university. 

00:01:29.160,00:01:34.330
That co-op had a kitchen with a ceiling 
that had been cleaned by student volunteers 

00:01:34.730,00:01:36.860
probably every decade or so. 

00:01:39.090,00:01:43.530
Picture a college girl named Gloria, 
climbing up high on a ladder, 

00:01:43.920,00:01:46.340
struggling to clean that filthy ceiling. 

00:01:48.510,00:01:53.460
Standing on the floor, a young boarder 
named Carl was admiring the view. 

00:01:57.220,00:01:59.940
And that's how they met. 
They were my parents, 

00:02:05.260,00:02:11.090
so I suppose you could say I'm a direct result 
of that kitchen chemistry experiment, 

00:02:12.830,00:02:14.460
right here at Michigan. 

00:02:15.580,00:02:20.650
My Mom is here with us today, and we should 
probably go find the spot and put a plaque up

00:02:20.780,00:02:23.680
on the ceiling that says: "Thanks Mom and Dad!"

00:02:25.860,00:02:31.110
Everyone in my family went here at 
Michigan: me, my brother, my Mom and Dad 

00:02:31.320,00:02:32.290
-- all of us. 

00:02:32.550,00:02:35.740
My Dad actually got the quantity 
discount: all three and a half of his

00:02:35.840,00:02:38.040
degrees are from here. 

00:02:38.760,00:02:42.220
His Ph.D. was in Communication Science
because they thought Computers were 

00:02:42.310,00:02:44.160
just a passing fad. 

00:02:44.290,00:02:47.490
When he earned it 44 years ago. 

00:02:48.710,00:02:50.640
He and Mom made a big sacrifice for that. 

00:02:50.770,00:02:55.710
They argued at times over pennies, 
while raising my newborn brother. 

00:02:56.710,00:03:01.160
Mom typed my Dad's dissertation by hand.
Kind of ironic given it was a 

00:03:01.260,00:03:03.070
computer science dissertation. 

00:03:04.710,00:03:09.780
This velvet hood I'm wearing, 
this was my Dad's. 

00:03:20.420,00:03:25.430
This diploma, just like the one you're 
about to get, this was my Dad's. 

00:03:31.060,00:03:35.960
And my underwear... oh never mind. 
Sorry.

00:03:39.910,00:03:43.490
My father's father worked in the 
Chevy plant in Flint, Michigan. 

00:03:44.370,00:03:45.980
He was an assembly line worker. 

00:03:47.150,00:03:51.950
He drove his two children here to Ann Arbor,
and told them: That is where you're

00:03:52.010,00:03:53.800
going to go to college. 

00:03:55.550,00:03:57.130
I know it sounds funny now.

00:03:58.270,00:04:00.980
Both of his kids did graduate
from Michigan. 

00:04:01.600,00:04:03.460
That was the American dream. 

00:04:04.430,00:04:06.870
His daughter, Beverly, is with us today. 

00:04:07.910,00:04:12.790
My Grandpa used to carry an "Alley Oop" 
hammer -- a heavy iron pipe with a hunk

00:04:12.940,00:04:14.870
of lead melted on the end. 

00:04:15.470,00:04:18.620
The workers made them during the sit-down 
strikes to protect themselves. 

00:04:19.320,00:04:22.790
When I was growing up, we used that hammer
whenever we needed to pound a stake or 

00:04:22.890,00:04:26.930
something into the ground. 
It is wonderful that most people don't 

00:04:27.030,00:04:29.810
need to carry a heavy blunt object 
for protection anymore. 

00:04:31.530,00:04:34.360
But just in case, I brought it with me.

00:04:44.480,00:04:45.330
Al right...

00:04:45.890,00:04:49.620
My Dad became a professor at... 
Michigan State, 

00:04:56.000,00:04:57.760
and I was an incredibly lucky boy. 

00:04:58.170,00:05:02.180
A professor's life is pretty flexible, 
and he was able to spend oodles of

00:05:02.310,00:05:03.730
time raising me. 

00:05:04.110,00:05:06.940
Could there be a better upbringing
than university brat?

00:05:08.930,00:05:11.700
What I'm trying to tell you is that this 
is WAY more than just a homecoming for me. 

00:05:11.940,00:05:16.850
It's not easy for me to express how proud 
I am to be here, with my Mom, my brother 

00:05:16.940,00:05:21.440
and my wife Lucy, and with all of you, 
at this amazing institution that is 

00:05:21.530,00:05:23.610
responsible for my very existence. 

00:05:24.780,00:05:28.410
I am thrilled for all of you, and I'm 
thrilled for your families and friends, 

00:05:28.540,00:05:32.800
as all of us join the great, 
big Michigan family I feel I've been

00:05:32.890,00:05:34.710
a part of all of my life.

00:05:36.230,00:05:38.680
What I'm also trying to tell you is that 
I know exactly what it feels like to be 

00:05:38.760,00:05:41.030
sitting in your seat, 
listening to some old gasbag 

00:05:41.130,00:05:42.910
give a long-winded commencement speech. 

00:05:43.340,00:05:45.110
Don't worry. I'll be brief.

00:05:46.220,00:05:48.250
I have a story about following dreams. 

00:05:49.320,00:05:50.780
Or maybe more accurately, 

00:05:50.920,00:05:54.330
it's a story about finding a 
path to make those dreams real.

00:05:56.170,00:05:58.910
You know what it's like to wake up in 
the middle of the night with a vivid dream? 

00:05:59.510,00:06:01.820
And you know how, if you don't 
have a pencil and pad by the bed,

00:06:02.430,00:06:04.880
it will be completely 
gone the next morning?

00:06:07.140,00:06:09.380
Well, I had one of those dreams 
when I was 23. 

00:06:10.120,00:06:11.570
When I suddenly woke up, I was thinking:

00:06:11.990,00:06:16.190
what if we could download the whole web,
and just keep the links and... 

00:06:16.270,00:06:18.540
I grabbed a pen and started writing! 

00:06:19.030,00:06:22.130
Sometimes it is important to 
wake up and stop dreaming. 

00:06:23.250,00:06:26.320
I spent the middle of that night 
scribbling out the details and 

00:06:26.440,00:06:28.210
convincing myself it would work. 

00:06:29.210,00:06:33.400
Soon after, I told my advisor, 
Terry Winograd, it would take 

00:06:33.490,00:06:35.470
a couple of weeks to download the web -- 

00:06:36.140,00:06:41.260
he nodded knowingly, fully aware 
it would take much longer but 

00:06:41.330,00:06:43.180
wise enough to not tell me. 

00:06:44.540,00:06:49.780
The optimism of youth is often underrated!
Amazingly, At that time I had no thought 

00:06:49.860,00:06:51.590
of building a search engine. 

00:06:51.910,00:06:53.540
The idea wasn't even on the radar. 

00:06:54.540,00:06:59.240
But, much later we happened upon a 
better way of ranking and we made 

00:06:59.340,00:07:01.790
a really great search engine, 
and Google was born. 

00:07:02.370,00:07:04.940
When a really great dream shows up, 
grab it!

00:07:17.510,00:07:21.040
When I was here at Michigan, I had 
actually been taught how to make dreams real!

00:07:21.220,00:07:24.860
I know it sounds funny, but that is what 
I learned in a summer camp converted 

00:07:24.940,00:07:27.540
into a training program called Leadershape. 

00:07:29.410,00:07:31.020
Yeh, we got a few out there.

00:07:32.510,00:07:36.580
Their slogan is to have a 
"healthy disregard for the impossible". 

00:07:37.630,00:07:40.940
That program encouraged me to 
pursue a crazy idea at the time: 

00:07:41.330,00:07:47.100
I wanted to build a personal rapid transit
system on campus to replace the buses. 

00:07:48.870,00:07:50.480
Yeh, you're still working on that, I hear.

00:07:52.970,00:07:56.270
It was a futuristic way of 
solving our transportation problem. 

00:07:57.460,00:08:00.780
I still think a lot about transportation 
-- you never loose a dream, 

00:08:01.620,00:08:04.460
it just incubates as a hobby. 

00:08:05.410,00:08:08.870
Many things that people labor hard 
to do now, like cooking, cleaning, 

00:08:08.970,00:08:13.650
and driving will require much 
less human time in the future. 

00:08:14.320,00:08:17.770
That is, if we "have a healthy 
disregard for the impossible" 

00:08:17.920,00:08:19.850
and actually build new solutions.

00:08:21.410,00:08:24.750
I think it is often easier to make 
progress on mega-ambitious dreams. 

00:08:25.590,00:08:27.290
I know that sounds completely nuts. 

00:08:28.040,00:08:29.920
But, since no one else is 
crazy enough to do it, 

00:08:30.070,00:08:32.320
you have little competition. 

00:08:34.400,00:08:37.540
In fact, there are so few people 
this crazy that I feel like 

00:08:37.650,00:08:39.700
I know them all by first name. 

00:08:40.970,00:08:44.900
They all travel as if they are pack 
dogs and stick to each other like glue. 

00:08:46.250,00:08:48.990
The best people want 
to work the big challenges. 

00:08:50.110,00:08:51.790
That is what happened with Google. 

00:08:52.460,00:08:56.500
Our mission is to organize the world's 
information and make it universally 

00:08:56.620,00:08:58.880
accessible and useful. 

00:09:00.570,00:09:02.630
How can that not get you excited? 

00:09:04.370,00:09:07.740
But we almost didn't start Google 
because my co-founder Sergey and I 

00:09:07.820,00:09:11.090
were too worried about 
dropping out of our Ph.D. program. 

00:09:12.060,00:09:13.860
None of you have that issue, it seems.

00:09:15.710,00:09:18.830
You are probably on the right track 
if you feel like a sidewalk worm 

00:09:18.930,00:09:20.450
during a rainstorm! 

00:09:22.220,00:09:26.780
That is about how we felt after we maxed 
out three credit cards buying hard disks 

00:09:26.890,00:09:28.470
off the back of a truck. 

00:09:29.840,00:09:32.280
That was actually the first
hardware for Google. 

00:09:32.870,00:09:36.820
Parents and friends: 
more credit cards always help. 

00:09:39.770,00:09:42.300
What is the one sentence summary 
of how you change the world? 

00:09:42.890,00:09:46.350
Always work hard on something 
uncomfortably exciting!

00:09:47.140,00:09:51.460
As a Ph.D. student, I actually had 
three projects I wanted to work on. 

00:09:51.640,00:09:55.150
Thank goodness my advisor said, 
"why don't you work on the web for a while". 

00:09:56.240,00:09:59.500
He gave me some seriously good advice 
because the web was really growing with 

00:09:59.560,00:10:02.320
people and activity, even in 1995! 

00:10:03.010,00:10:07.170
Technology and especially the 
internet can really help you be lazy. 

00:10:08.360,00:10:12.880
Lazy? What I mean is a group of three 
people can write software that 

00:10:13.010,00:10:15.160
then millions can use and enjoy. 

00:10:15.820,00:10:18.210
Can three people answer 
the phone a million times? 

00:10:19.160,00:10:21.920
Find the leverage in the world, 
so you can be more lazy!

00:10:32.110,00:10:35.590
Overall, I know it seems like 
the world is crumbling out there, 

00:10:36.290,00:10:40.090
but it is actually a great time in your
life to get a little crazy, follow your

00:10:40.250,00:10:43.300
curiosity, and be ambitious about it. 

00:10:43.990,00:10:47.600
Don't give up on your dreams. 
The world needs you all!

00:10:50.100,00:10:51.300
So here's my final story:

00:10:52.870,00:10:55.220
On a day like today, 
you might feel exhilarated — 

00:10:55.850,00:11:00.420
like you've just been shot out of a cannon
at the circus -- and even invincible. 

00:11:01.650,00:11:03.940
Don't ever forget that incredible feeling. 

00:11:04.620,00:11:08.880
But also: always remember that the moments
we have with friends and family, 

00:11:09.530,00:11:13.250
the chances we have to do things that might
make a big difference in the world,

00:11:13.380,00:11:17.210
or even to make a small difference to 
someone you love — all those wonderful

00:11:17.350,00:11:21.260
chances that life gives us, 
life also takes away. 

00:11:22.390,00:11:24.970
It can happen fast, and a whole 
lot sooner than you think.

00:11:26.000,00:11:30.100
In late March 1996, soon after I had 
moved to Stanford for grad school, 

00:11:30.500,00:11:33.390
my Dad had difficultly breathing 
and drove to the hospital. 

00:11:35.360,00:11:37.460
Two months later, he died. 

00:11:38.610,00:11:40.320
I was completely devastated. 

00:11:42.220,00:11:46.910
Many years later, after a startup, 
after falling in love, and after so 

00:11:47.060,00:11:51.160
many of life's adventures, 
I found myself thinking about my Dad. 

00:11:52.420,00:11:57.600
Lucy and I were far away in a steaming 
hot village walking through narrow streets. 

00:11:58.550,00:12:00.720
There were wonderful 
friendly people everywhere, 

00:12:01.560,00:12:05.690
but it was a desperately poor place -- 
people used the bathroom inside and 

00:12:05.890,00:12:09.020
it flowed out into the open gutter 
and straight into the river. 

00:12:10.120,00:12:15.100
We touched a boy with a limp leg,
the result of paralysis from polio. 

00:12:16.730,00:12:18.380
Lucy and I were in rural India -- 

00:12:20.010,00:12:22.800
one of the few places where 
Polio still exists. 

00:12:24.010,00:12:27.990
Polio is transmitted fecal to oral,
usually through filthy water. 

00:12:29.300,00:12:31.090
Well, my Dad had Polio. 

00:12:31.980,00:12:35.860
He went on a trip to Tennessee 
in the first grade and caught it. 

00:12:36.350,00:12:39.910
He was hospitalized for two months and 
had to be transported by military DC-3 

00:12:40.000,00:12:42.330
back home -- his first flight. 

00:12:42.990,00:12:46.030
My Dad wrote, "Then, I had to stay 
in bed for over a year, 

00:12:46.270,00:12:47.850
before I started back to school". 

00:12:48.810,00:12:51.790
That is actually a quote 
from his fifth grade autobiography. 

00:12:53.720,00:12:56.770
My Dad had difficulty breathing his 
whole life, and the complications 

00:12:56.870,00:13:00.980
of Polio are what took 
him from us too soon. 

00:13:01.900,00:13:04.630
He would have been very upset that 
Polio still persists even though 

00:13:04.710,00:13:06.200
we have a vaccine. 

00:13:06.730,00:13:10.020
He would have been equally upset that 
back in India we had polio virus on our 

00:13:10.090,00:13:13.550
shoes from walking through the contaminated 
gutters that spread the disease. 

00:13:14.190,00:13:16.870
We were spreading the virus 
with every footstep, 

00:13:17.050,00:13:20.420
right under beautiful kids 
playing everywhere. 

00:13:22.530,00:13:27.690
The world is on the verge of eliminating 
polio, with 328 people infected so far. 

00:13:28.620,00:13:32.250
Let's get it done soon. 
Perhaps one of you will do that.

00:13:43.050,00:13:48.270
My Dad was valedictorian of the 
Flint Mandeville High School class of 1956 

00:13:48.370,00:13:50.220
of about 90 kids. 

00:13:51.270,00:13:54.500
I happened across his graduating speech 
recently, and it blew me away. 

00:13:55.480,00:13:58.330
53 years ago at his 
graduation my Dad said: 

00:13:58.440,00:14:02.860
"...we are entering a changing world, 
one of automation and employment change 

00:14:02.950,00:14:05.440
where education is an economic necessity. 

00:14:06.410,00:14:10.440
We will have increased periods of time to 
do as we wish, as our work week and 

00:14:10.520,00:14:14.640
retirement age continue to decline... 
(Or we wish that were true....)

00:14:15.180,00:14:18.270
We shall take part in, or witness, 
developments in science, medicine, 

00:14:18.360,00:14:22.000
and industry that we can 
only dream of today. 

00:14:23.440,00:14:26.910
... It is said that the future of any 
nation can be determined by the care 

00:14:27.010,00:14:29.350
and preparation given to its youth. 

00:14:30.220,00:14:34.080
If all the youths of America were as 
fortunate in securing an education as 

00:14:34.180,00:14:38.020
we have been, then the future of the 
United States would be even more 

00:14:38.230,00:14:39.750
bright than it is today."

00:14:42.560,00:14:46.020
If my Dad was alive today, the thing I 
think he would be most happy about 

00:14:46.180,00:14:49.420
is that Lucy and I have a
baby in the hopper. 

00:14:52.840,00:14:55.470
Yeh, let's cheer Lucy.

00:14:58.680,00:15:01.280
I think he would have been annoyed that 
I hadn't gotten my Ph.D. yet 

00:15:01.470,00:15:02.880
(thanks, Michigan!). 

00:15:05.860,00:15:09.260
Dad was so full of insights, of excitement 
about new things, to this day, 

00:15:09.340,00:15:12.060
I often wonder what he would 
think about some new development. 

00:15:12.690,00:15:17.130
If he were here today -- well, it would 
be one of the best days of his life. 

00:15:18.080,00:15:22.740
He'd be like a kid in a candy store. 
For a day, he'd be young again.

00:15:24.470,00:15:26.850
Many of us are fortunate enough 
to be here with family. 

00:15:27.150,00:15:29.900
Some of us have dear friends 
and family to go home to. 

00:15:30.210,00:15:33.850
And who knows, perhaps some of you, 
like Lucy and I, are dreaming of 

00:15:33.920,00:15:35.770
future families of your own. 

00:15:36.870,00:15:41.540
Just like me, your families brought you 
here, and you brought them here. 

00:15:42.400,00:15:47.850
Please keep them close and remember: 
they are what really matters in life.

00:15:49.060,00:15:50.670
Thanks, Mom; 

00:15:51.050,00:15:52.530
Thanks, Lucy.

00:15:52.870,00:15:55.950
And thank you, all, very much.
