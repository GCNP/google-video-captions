*TC 00:00:01;14  
I wanted to talk to you a
little bit about the 

*TC 00:00:03;16
google apex 
language API

*TC 00:00:06;17
I was playing around with a
little bookmarklet 

*TC 00:00:11;00
that we can use here 
say 

*TC 00:00:12;18
looking at 
my twitter.

*TC 00:00:14;03
We've got the odd thing here
that's in a different language.

*TC 00:00:16;16
So we've got something in
French and 

*TC 00:00:18;03
I've got no idea what 
that means. 

*TC 00:00:20;08
So I can just
go and select it.

*TC 00:00:21;25
Hit translate and it's 
going to go through 

*TC 00:00:23;26
and give me my
actual translation.

*TC 00:00:26;19
Going to move that around.

*TC 00:00:29;18
Same thing on the Real Madrid
side, 

*TC 00:00:31;27
watching the soccer,
wonder what Calderon actually said.

*TC 00:00:36;22
Go ahead.

*TC 00:00:38;13
Boom.  It's going to go through and
tell us

*TC 00:00:41;02
moments to enjoy together.

*TC 00:00:43;02
Now, of course, 

*TC 00:00:44;26
What this is getting back 
isn't going to be

*TC 00:00:46;22
the perfect translation.
That's really hard to do.

*TC 00:00:50;20
But it gives me
enough information.

*TC 00:00:53;23
For example, 
I was actually

*TC 00:00:54;28
playing around with the bar 
code getting this in line

*TC 00:00:58;24
exception here when I was
actually building it out 

*TC 00:01:01;28
with a prototype widget, 

*TC 00:01:02;26
so I just
wanted to see
 
*TC 00:01:04;01
kinda what
people were saying 

*TC 00:01:05;20
and the
answers and stuff 

*TC 00:01:06;24
were actually on 
a German site.  So

*TC 00:01:08;22
again like this, I can go
through

*TC 00:01:10;15
get the
translation and

*TC 00:01:11;25 
it gives me
enough information 

*TC 00:01:13;19
so I can kind of know what 
they're saying 

*TC 00:01:15;18
even though the
translation 

*TC 00:01:19;02
isn't actually perfect.

*TC 00:01:22;02
So this bookmarklet is just
something I created quickly and

*TC 00:01:25;26
the bulk of the code is just
this piece right here, 

*TC 00:01:29;00
doing the 
actual translation.

*TC 00:01:30;04
I am going through, doing a
load of the language API

*TC 00:01:34;21
and I'm giving it a little 
bit of information  

*TC 00:01:37;06
on what I want back.

*TC 00:01:39;10
And them I'm first doing a
detect to try and 

*TC 00:01:41;23
have the system 
automatically know 

*TC 00:01:43;20
this is probably Spanish, 
this is Italian, 

*TC 00:01:45;14
this is German and
then once 

*TC 00:01:48;16
we actually have
something back there, 

*TC 00:01:49;24
where it thinks 
it has something 

*TC 00:01:51;00
it will actually 
going through 

*TC 00:01:51;22
and doing
the translation. 

*TC 00:01:53;21
So then it's going to try and
do the translation 

*TC 00:01:56;06
and 

*TC 00:01:58;06
if there's something there 

*TC 00:01:59;11
it's going to go through and
translate it for me 

*TC 00:02:01;20
otherwise
it's going to tell me

*TC 00:02:03;09
that it's not.

*TC 00:02:05;14
So we go down here, all I'm
really doing is 

*TC 00:02:08;05
doing the display logic, so 
this is that call

*TC 00:02:11;24
that you send up 
that little window 

*TC 00:02:13;12
using the new
prototype UI window here

*TC 00:02:16;21
to set the information.

*TC 00:02:18;14
Headers and footers
and stuff,

*TC 00:02:19;21
and if this didn't get 
loaded for some reason, 

*TC 00:02:21;25
because with a
bookmarklet, 

*TC 00:02:24;00
sometimes you
get collisions 

*TC 00:02:25;13
and stuff 
like that. 

*TC 00:02:27;15
Just go ahead and unlocked in
kind of a simple way.

*TC 00:02:31;04
And then this is all of the
ugly hackery to actually 

*TC 00:02:34;16
load in the files from
the bookmarklet.

*TC 00:02:36;24
So, go through and actually
load the main java script

*TC 00:02:39;28
load the css for that, that
little widget.

*TC 00:02:43;20
And then finally to get things
kicked off 

*TC 00:02:46;05
this is the actual initial call 
to load the Google APIs.

*TC 00:02:50;14
And then notice here,
we've added a callback.

*TC 00:02:53;12
And this is actually fairly
new, it's months old, 

*TC 00:02:57;06 
but it's a fairly new way to 
group a dynamic access 

*TC 00:03:00;28
so the chain
will go through 

*TC 00:03:03;14
go through and it's going to 
call that API-loaded.

*TC 00:03:07;09
If we don't have that, it will
just manually call it.

*TC 00:03:09;28
And then that's when things
kind of kick off, 

*TC 00:03:11;24
it will kick off 
to this guy 

*TC 00:03:13;15
who then will
start doing his work.

*TC 00:03:15;16
And again, we have another
callback that's going on here

*TC 00:03:18;11
so we've kinda got this
recursive callbacks 

*TC 00:03:20;19
that give us what we need.

*TC 00:03:23;14
One other little kinda cool
thing that I 

*TC 00:03:26;23
noticed the other day was 
the Mibbit IRC client 

*TC 00:03:30;10
is purely web based
 
*TC 00:03:31;24
and if we go into a chat room
that's hopefully talking 

*TC 00:03:36;08
we can see this new translation.

*TC 00:03:42;04
And we can go through and say
take the English and 

*TC 00:03:48;24
make it French and now if people
actually started to talk on this.

*TC 00:03:53;15
Like that. 

*TC 00:03:54;02
we see it automatically did 
the translation into French.

*TC 00:03:56;27
So it took the English, right
worked it out did it to French. 

*TC 00:04:00;14
And then to translate me would
be, if I were in a channel

*TC 00:04:05;12
where I didn't speak English,
I could then come in and 

*TC 00:04:08;09
type in my native tongue
and it would translate it

01:04:10;16
into English for me.

*TC 00:04:13;06
Again, I think this is
pretty cool.

*TC 00:04:16;19
And then one last piece of the
puzzle is 

*TC 00:04:18;25
if you go into the documentation 
you may notice that we just added 

*TC 00:04:22;16
this new Flash and other Non-
Javascript Environments piece.

*TC 00:04:26;06
This means you can now go
through 

*TC 00:04:27;28
and you can do translations from 
the server side. 

*TC 00:04:30;27
So not just going through the
Ajax world, 

*TC 00:04:34;06
you can just go through, 
do a little Json call

*TC 00:04:37;14
that you can always just mimic
in here to do the translation.

*TC 00:04:40;29
You can do it or using
service-side technology 


*TC 00:04:44;08
or anything that can understand
http and Json.

*TC 00:04:48;06
So, I hope you guys are making
some interesting uses 

*TC 00:04:51;07
out of the new language API.
