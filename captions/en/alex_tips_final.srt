Moffat: A couple of tips
for using Google Web Toolkit.

2
00:00:03,167 --> 00:00:05,467
When you're compiling
to JavaScript for testing,

3
00:00:05,467 --> 00:00:08,334
uh, make sure you modify
your moduled XML file

4
00:00:08,334 --> 00:00:09,901
so that you
only build JavaScript

5
00:00:09,901 --> 00:00:11,567
for the browser
you're actually targeting.

6
00:00:11,567 --> 00:00:14,234
There's no point in producing
"IE 6" JavaScript

7
00:00:14,234 --> 00:00:16,667
if you're only
gonna be testing "Firefox 3."

8
00:00:16,667 --> 00:00:19,367
My second tip's
about performance.

9
00:00:19,367 --> 00:00:21,834
If you find that
your performance is limited

10
00:00:21,834 --> 00:00:24,367
by the performance
of the HashMat implementation,

11
00:00:24,367 --> 00:00:27,000
you can look at using
Fast StringMap instead.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,400
If all your keys
are strings,

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,767
this can give you
quite a boost.
