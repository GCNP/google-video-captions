00:00:00,934 --> 00:00:01,834
Sharkey: Hi.
My name is Jeff Sharkey.

2
00:00:01,834 --> 00:00:04,467
And I'm a student
from Montana State University.

3
00:00:04,467 --> 00:00:06,934
I wrote an Android application
called CompareEverywhere.

4
00:00:06,934 --> 00:00:09,100
And I'd like to show it to you
on my phone today.

5
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,634
Let's go ahead and get it
started up.

6
00:00:10,634 --> 00:00:12,667
And when we open it,
we have three different options.

7
00:00:12,667 --> 00:00:14,801
We could scan a barcode,
run a full text search,

8
00:00:14,801 --> 00:00:16,033
or look at lists of items

9
00:00:16,033 --> 00:00:17,701
that we might have stored
before in the past.

10
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:20,300
In this case, I found a CD
that I'm interested in.

11
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,234
We can tap and scan
the barcode with our phone.

12
00:00:27,534 --> 00:00:28,534
So in this case,

13
00:00:28,534 --> 00:00:29,801
we found
several different options

14
00:00:29,801 --> 00:00:31,167
for going out and buying
this item.

15
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:32,334
We can look through
that list.

16
00:00:32,334 --> 00:00:34,234
We see there's several
online stores,

17
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:36,167
and also some local stores
in our neighborhood,

18
00:00:36,167 --> 00:00:37,767
as well as a local library

19
00:00:37,767 --> 00:00:39,701
that we could go
and borrow the item.

20
00:00:39,701 --> 00:00:41,934
In this case, we can also map
those local stores

21
00:00:41,934 --> 00:00:43,434
to look at all
of the different options.

22
00:00:43,434 --> 00:00:45,667
If I know I'm going down
to a neighborhood later today,

23
00:00:45,667 --> 00:00:48,067
I could zoom in to see what
stores are available in the area

24
00:00:48,067 --> 00:00:49,334
and what prices they have.

25
00:00:49,334 --> 00:00:51,267
In this case, I'm interested
in this store.

26
00:00:51,267 --> 00:00:52,934
I can tap on that
and I can look at

27
00:00:52,934 --> 00:00:55,067
see driving directions
to the store location

28
00:00:55,067 --> 00:00:56,234
or I could call them
to make sure

29
00:00:56,234 --> 00:00:58,067
that they actually have it
in stock.

30
00:00:58,067 --> 00:01:00,133
I can also look at lists
of items.

31
00:01:00,133 --> 00:01:01,501
So let's say
like a shopping list

32
00:01:01,501 --> 00:01:02,868
as I walk through
the store.

33
00:01:02,868 --> 00:01:05,567
If I know I need to pick up
a certain number of items.

34
00:01:05,567 --> 00:01:08,667
I can easily cross those items
off my list as I buy them

35
00:01:08,667 --> 00:01:10,334
as I walk through the store.

36
00:01:11,868 --> 00:01:13,801
So I got the idea
for this application

37
00:01:13,801 --> 00:01:16,501
a couple years ago
as I was watching a documentary.

38
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:18,767
I saw an employee in a store
scan a barcode

39
00:01:18,767 --> 00:01:20,467
and be able to check
the inventory that they had

40
00:01:20,467 --> 00:01:22,467
in the back room as well as
the pricing they'd had

41
00:01:22,467 --> 00:01:24,334
over the past couple years.

42
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,367
I thought to myself,
why couldn't people everywhere

43
00:01:26,367 --> 00:01:28,501
have that kind of functionality
on their phones

44
00:01:28,501 --> 00:01:30,434
as they walk through stores?

45
00:01:30,434 --> 00:01:31,868
So to build
this application,

46
00:01:31,868 --> 00:01:35,033
I used several different
APIs pieced together.

47
00:01:35,033 --> 00:01:36,834
I used the camera
that's built into the phone

48
00:01:36,834 --> 00:01:39,601
along with the ZXing library,
which is an Open Source library

49
00:01:39,601 --> 00:01:41,601
written by several people
at Google, uh,

50
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,901
to decode the barcodes.

51
00:01:42,901 --> 00:01:45,133
I also used
the Google Maps API

52
00:01:45,133 --> 00:01:47,968
to be able to show the local
stores in a person's area.

53
00:01:47,968 --> 00:01:49,834
And finally, I used
the location manager

54
00:01:49,834 --> 00:01:52,267
to make sure that we
always select local stores

55
00:01:52,267 --> 00:01:53,601
that are around the user.

56
00:01:53,601 --> 00:01:55,300
In all, using those APIs,

57
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,567
it only took me
about two white--

58
00:01:56,567 --> 00:01:57,901
two weeks to write.
