00:00:01,067 --> 00:00:03,100
Hsu: So as a company
and as a developer,

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,968
most of our experience
is not mobile,

3
00:00:04,968 --> 00:00:06,534
but actually on the desktop.

4
00:00:06,534 --> 00:00:09,634
Client--when we were talking
about client applications.

5
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:13,234
And Android was really nice,
because the platform provides

6
00:00:13,234 --> 00:00:16,534
a lot of very desktop
kind of features.

7
00:00:16,534 --> 00:00:18,601
It's not like
a watered-down mobile app--

8
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:20,834
uh, mobile
operating system, really.

9
00:00:20,834 --> 00:00:23,300
You get a lot of powerful things
on the platform.

10
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,200
One thing I would
like to see, however,

11
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,400
is richer media APIs.

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,934
The existing APIs
let us get

13
00:00:30,934 --> 00:00:32,467
what we get done
on the phone now,

14
00:00:32,467 --> 00:00:34,467
but, uh, we'd really like
to do some other things,

15
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:38,100
and, uh, it doesn't really
have that--

16
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,067
that, uh, flexibility yet.
