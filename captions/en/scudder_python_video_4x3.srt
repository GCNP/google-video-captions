00:00:06,033 --> 00:00:07,467
Scudder: Hi,
I'm Jeff Scudder,

2
00:00:07,467 --> 00:00:08,968
and I'll be talking
with you today

3
00:00:08,968 --> 00:00:10,868
about getting started
with the Python Library

4
00:00:10,868 --> 00:00:12,934
for Google Data APIs.

5
00:00:12,934 --> 00:00:15,033
The first thing
we're gonna need to do

6
00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:18,367
is make sure that Python
is available on your system.

7
00:00:18,367 --> 00:00:20,634
Let's get started.

8
00:00:20,634 --> 00:00:22,534
Now, in many operating systems,

9
00:00:22,534 --> 00:00:24,934
Python is already installed
by default.

10
00:00:24,934 --> 00:00:27,267
To see if Python is available,

11
00:00:27,267 --> 00:00:29,767
bring up a terminal
or command prompt

12
00:00:29,767 --> 00:00:35,000
and type python-V to see
which version you're running.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,033
if you're on Mac or Linux,

14
00:00:37,033 --> 00:00:40,033
this is probably
already available.

15
00:00:40,033 --> 00:00:41,601
But on a Windows system,

16
00:00:41,601 --> 00:00:45,334
you'll need to install
Python yourself.

17
00:00:45,334 --> 00:00:46,767
To install Python,

18
00:00:46,767 --> 00:00:49,534
begin by downloading
from python.org.

19
00:00:49,534 --> 00:00:51,901
You can find
the correct installer

20
00:00:51,901 --> 00:00:53,467
for your version.

21
00:00:53,467 --> 00:00:56,133
Once this is downloaded,

22
00:00:56,133 --> 00:00:59,601
you can install as you would
any other Windows program.

23
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:04,601
I recommend downloading
Python 2.5, the latest version.

24
00:01:04,601 --> 00:01:08,167
Anything that's version 2.2
or later

25
00:01:08,167 --> 00:01:10,300
will work
with the Python Library,

26
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,000
but 2.5 is easier to set up.

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,100
Once you've installed Python,

28
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:19,300
we need to make sure that it
will run in the command line.

29
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,968
To do this, we need to edit
the Windows execution path.

30
00:01:26,501 --> 00:01:30,334
You can edit the execution path
under the System settings,

31
00:01:30,334 --> 00:01:34,601
so we'll go to Control Panel,
System.

32
00:01:34,601 --> 00:01:37,300
Go to Advanced.

33
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,400
Click on Environment Variables

34
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:44,467
and find Path
under System variables.

35
00:01:44,467 --> 00:01:47,801
Click the edit button
to modify it.

36
00:01:47,801 --> 00:01:49,567
At the end of the path,

37
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,100
we need to add the location

38
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,133
where we've just installed
Python.

39
00:01:57,734 --> 00:02:01,534
Once you're done,
click OK...

40
00:02:01,534 --> 00:02:04,000
and OK again...

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,701
and OK one last time.

42
00:02:06,701 --> 00:02:09,367
Now you should be able
to run Python

43
00:02:09,367 --> 00:02:12,567
to see which version
you have on the command line.

44
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:17,868
Now that we can run Python
on the command line,

45
00:02:17,868 --> 00:02:19,667
we need to make sure
that the dependencies

46
00:02:19,667 --> 00:02:24,200
that the Python Library needs
are available on the system.

47
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,501
The main dependency that
the Python Client Library needs

48
00:02:27,501 --> 00:02:33,100
is ElementTree,
which is used for parsing XML.

49
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,033
If you have Python version 2.5
or higher,

50
00:02:37,033 --> 00:02:40,067
ElementTree is already available
on the system.

51
00:02:40,067 --> 00:02:44,000
But if you're using an older
version like 2.4 or 2.2,

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,267
You'll need to install
ElementTree yourself.

53
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:52,133
You can download the ElementTree
Library on fbot.org.

54
00:02:52,133 --> 00:02:53,601
To install ElementTree,

55
00:02:53,601 --> 00:02:55,334
begin by downloading
the version

56
00:02:55,334 --> 00:02:57,467
that's appropriate
for your system.

57
00:02:57,467 --> 00:03:00,067
I chose to download
the zip file,

58
00:03:00,067 --> 00:03:02,234
which I'll un-archive
and install

59
00:03:02,234 --> 00:03:04,567
on the command line.

60
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:07,367
Now that we've downloaded
and unpacked ElementTree,

61
00:03:07,367 --> 00:03:09,667
we're ready to install.

62
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:11,934
To install
the ElementTree Library,

63
00:03:11,934 --> 00:03:16,667
go to the unzip directory...

64
00:03:16,667 --> 00:03:22,968
and install using
python setup.py install.

65
00:03:28,734 --> 00:03:31,300
Now that ElementTree
is installed,

66
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,434
you can optionally install
cElementTree,

67
00:03:34,434 --> 00:03:37,734
which is a faster version
of ElementTree.

68
00:03:37,734 --> 00:03:40,434
The installation process
for cElementTree

69
00:03:40,434 --> 00:03:42,834
is the same as I've just shown
for ElementTree

70
00:03:42,834 --> 00:03:46,667
where you use Python
setup.py install.

71
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:48,234
Now that we know

72
00:03:48,234 --> 00:03:50,334
that ElementTree is installed
on our system,

73
00:03:50,334 --> 00:03:54,167
we're ready to download
and install the Python Library.

74
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:55,968
From the Projects Home page,

75
00:03:55,968 --> 00:04:02,968
which is at code.google.com/p
/gdata-python-client,

76
00:04:02,968 --> 00:04:05,868
you can find
the latest download.

77
00:04:07,801 --> 00:04:10,701
Download the zip file
and unpack it.

78
00:04:10,701 --> 00:04:14,100
Once you've unpacked
this download,

79
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,067
we can install it

80
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:19,734
using a setup script
as we did earlier.

81
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:33,534
Simply type python setup.py
install to run the installer.

82
00:04:33,534 --> 00:04:35,667
Now that we've installed
the Library,

83
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:37,467
we can make sure
that it's working

84
00:04:37,467 --> 00:04:39,300
by running some of
the unit tests

85
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,701
that are bundled with it.

86
00:04:41,701 --> 00:04:45,567
Go into the tests directory.

87
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:53,434
run_data_tests is a suite
that should execute quickly.

88
00:04:53,434 --> 00:05:00,567
So type python run_data_tests
to run the test script.

89
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:02,467
If all the tests pass,

90
00:05:02,467 --> 00:05:06,167
then you can be sure that you've
installed the Library correctly.

91
00:05:06,167 --> 00:05:08,167
Now that we've installed
the Library,

92
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:11,834
let's get a general idea
for how it's structured.

93
00:05:11,834 --> 00:05:15,567
You can browse the source code
here on code.google.com

94
00:05:15,567 --> 00:05:19,767
on the Projects site,
gdata-python-client.

95
00:05:22,868 --> 00:05:24,634
You can see here
that the source code

96
00:05:24,634 --> 00:05:27,400
is divided up between atom
and gdata.

97
00:05:30,968 --> 00:05:35,767
Gdata contains modules
for parsing XML

98
00:05:35,767 --> 00:05:41,434
and for making HTTP requests
to Google servers.

99
00:05:41,434 --> 00:05:45,634
There are two types of modules
in general.

100
00:05:45,634 --> 00:05:48,634
In each of the product's
specific directories,

101
00:05:48,634 --> 00:05:51,667
you'll find a module
that's responsible

102
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:54,033
for parsing XML

103
00:05:54,033 --> 00:05:57,467
and one that's responsible
for talking to Services.

104
00:05:57,467 --> 00:06:00,267
You can browse
the source code as well.

105
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,934
There's also auto-generated
documentation

106
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:09,667
available online

107
00:06:09,667 --> 00:06:12,667
which you can find
from the Project Home page.

108
00:06:17,534 --> 00:06:19,300
If we wanted to, for example,

109
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,667
take a look at the different
Data Model classes

110
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:25,067
that are available
for a blogger,

111
00:06:25,067 --> 00:06:29,200
you could view this
auto-generated documentation.

112
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,868
You can see here
that we have things like

113
00:06:31,868 --> 00:06:35,667
BlogFeeds and CommentFeeds.

114
00:06:35,667 --> 00:06:38,267
If you wanted to take a look
at the Service Module,

115
00:06:38,267 --> 00:06:42,100
which shows the HTTP requests
that can be made,

116
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,667
you would click
on Blogger Service,

117
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:48,367
take a look at some
of the different methods.

118
00:06:52,634 --> 00:06:55,567
For example,
Blogger Service has methods

119
00:06:55,567 --> 00:06:57,968
that help you add comments,
add posts,

120
00:06:57,968 --> 00:07:00,467
delete comments, etcetera.

121
00:07:00,467 --> 00:07:03,300
Now let's get an idea
for how to use the Library

122
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,634
by looking
at an interactive sample.

123
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:08,434
I'm going to start
by reading the titles

124
00:07:08,434 --> 00:07:11,601
from the
Google Data APIs Blog

125
00:07:11,601 --> 00:07:15,167
and then show
how you can post a new blogpost

126
00:07:15,167 --> 00:07:18,434
to one of your blogs.

127
00:07:18,434 --> 00:07:20,267
From the command line,

128
00:07:20,267 --> 00:07:23,267
we'll begin by running
the Python Interpreter.

129
00:07:23,267 --> 00:07:25,067
The first thing
we'll need to import

130
00:07:25,067 --> 00:07:31,100
is the module for Blogger.

131
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,167
We'll also import
the atom module,

132
00:07:33,167 --> 00:07:36,467
which will help us construct
the elements that we're sending

133
00:07:36,467 --> 00:07:38,567
to the Blogger Service.

134
00:07:38,567 --> 00:07:41,000
Now we'll need
to create a client

135
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,200
which is responsible for talking
to the Google servers.

136
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:56,868
Now that we have our client,

137
00:07:56,868 --> 00:07:58,968
we can use our user name
and password

138
00:07:58,968 --> 00:08:02,033
to authenticate
with Google servers

139
00:08:02,033 --> 00:08:03,834
to make sure
that we have permission

140
00:08:03,834 --> 00:08:06,200
to post our new blog posts
later on.

141
00:08:16,467 --> 00:08:18,868
Now that we have our client,

142
00:08:18,868 --> 00:08:20,634
we're ready to get the feed
of blog posts

143
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:22,968
from the Google Data
APIs Blog.

144
00:08:29,934 --> 00:08:33,167
We'll paste in the URL
of the blog feed.

145
00:08:39,534 --> 00:08:43,100
And now we should have
our feed object.

146
00:08:46,467 --> 00:08:50,968
You can see that the feed
contains multiple entries.

147
00:08:50,968 --> 00:08:53,667
We get 25 entries by default,

148
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:57,234
and we can print out
the titles of each entry

149
00:08:57,234 --> 00:08:58,968
as follows.

150
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,501
You can see
that we've printed the title

151
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:20,734
of the 25 most recent posts
to the Google Data APIs Blog.

152
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:24,901
Now let's show adding
a new post to our blog.

153
00:09:24,901 --> 00:09:26,434
I have a Test Blog here

154
00:09:26,434 --> 00:09:29,200
that I'd like to add
a new post to.

155
00:09:33,334 --> 00:09:36,868
To begin, I'll construct
a new atom entry.

156
00:09:42,901 --> 00:09:44,634
And I'll give it a title.

157
00:09:58,133 --> 00:10:00,534
I'll also give it some content.

158
00:10:15,601 --> 00:10:17,734
Now that we have our entry,

159
00:10:17,734 --> 00:10:19,701
we're ready to post it
to the blog.

160
00:10:22,801 --> 00:10:26,100
We'll tell our client
to perform a post,

161
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,267
sending our entry
to the blog's feed URL.

162
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,334
Now we have our new entry...

163
00:10:49,501 --> 00:10:53,901
We can see the ID
of the new blog post.

164
00:10:53,901 --> 00:10:56,434
And we can also see
that our blog post

165
00:10:56,434 --> 00:10:58,667
is now on the blog.

166
00:11:01,567 --> 00:11:04,267
Now that we've seen this
simple example with Blogger,

167
00:11:04,267 --> 00:11:07,300
let's take a look at where
you can find more resources

168
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,934
to use other
Google Data Services.

169
00:11:09,934 --> 00:11:12,701
There's a list
of supported services

170
00:11:12,701 --> 00:11:15,367
on the Project Home page.

171
00:11:15,367 --> 00:11:18,968
Each of these lists a detailed
step-by-step documentation

172
00:11:18,968 --> 00:11:21,968
for using the various
Google Data Services.

173
00:11:24,067 --> 00:11:26,767
For example, to show more
of the things that you could do

174
00:11:26,767 --> 00:11:29,167
with the Blogger API
and the Python Library,

175
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:31,868
take a look
