1
00:00:01,467 --> 00:00:02,868
Thanks a lot.

2
00:00:02,868 --> 00:00:04,200
You know,
that was pretty cool.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,234
But I'd actually
like to see something

4
00:00:06,234 --> 00:00:08,167
that uses
Google Web Toolkit a bit more

5
00:00:08,167 --> 00:00:09,868
and App Engine more
to sort of test the limits

6
00:00:09,868 --> 00:00:13,734
and shows exactly how easy
Google Web Toolkit makes it

7
00:00:13,734 --> 00:00:16,767
to build very rich,
powerful web applications.

8
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:18,734
So to do that,
I'd like to invite up

9
00:00:18,734 --> 00:00:20,400
Iein from Appirio

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,868
who's been working
on some applications

11
00:00:21,868 --> 00:00:24,067
using Google Web Toolkit
and App Engine.

12
00:00:24,067 --> 00:00:25,534
He'll show them
to you now.

13
00:00:26,601 --> 00:00:29,334
Thanks, Kevin.

14
00:00:29,334 --> 00:00:31,334
So I'm Iein Valdez,
a product manager

15
00:00:31,334 --> 00:00:32,868
and developer
with Appirio.

16
00:00:32,868 --> 00:00:34,200
If you haven't heard of us,

17
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,067
we helped some of the
largest companies in the world

18
00:00:36,067 --> 00:00:37,300
do more with on-demand

19
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,167
and take advantage
of the cloud companies

20
00:00:39,167 --> 00:00:41,567
like Genentec,
Qualcomm, and Starbucks.

21
00:00:41,567 --> 00:00:43,734
So I'm here tonight
to tell you about

22
00:00:43,734 --> 00:00:46,634
my experience building
a real customer application

23
00:00:46,634 --> 00:00:48,400
using Google Web Toolkit
and Java App Engine

24
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,634
and sort of
bringing together

25
00:00:49,634 --> 00:00:51,601
everything
we've seen tonight.

26
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:53,434
Now, in this particular case,

27
00:00:53,434 --> 00:00:56,734
I needed to build an app
to help a customer

28
00:00:56,734 --> 00:00:58,434
better manage
their recruiting process

29
00:00:58,434 --> 00:01:01,200
and get the word out
about new job openings.

30
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,567
Now, as a developer,

31
00:01:02,567 --> 00:01:04,801
I know Java but
I'm not an Ajax wizard,

32
00:01:04,801 --> 00:01:06,267
and it was important to me
to spend my time

33
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:08,400
writing my code
and not worrying about

34
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,067
how I was
going to deploy it,

35
00:01:10,067 --> 00:01:11,567
what stack
I was going to use,

36
00:01:11,567 --> 00:01:14,334
or the tools that
I was going to choose.

37
00:01:14,334 --> 00:01:16,400
So let me show you
what we built

38
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,367
end-to-end in Java
in just over a week.

39
00:01:23,234 --> 00:01:26,634
So here's
our recruiting app.

40
00:01:26,634 --> 00:01:28,100
And what you can see here

41
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,033
is that we were able to use
off-the-shelf GWT components

42
00:01:31,033 --> 00:01:34,934
to quickly put together
an effective interactive UI

43
00:01:34,934 --> 00:01:36,501
and also to style it.

44
00:01:36,501 --> 00:01:39,400
And this is the interface
that a hiring manager would see

45
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,934
when they log in to the app.

46
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:44,701
We even have some nice
visualizations of our data here.

47
00:01:44,701 --> 00:01:46,400
So let's go in

48
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,634
and let's take a look
at our applicant list here.

49
00:01:48,634 --> 00:01:50,767
So I'm going to go ahead
and click into "Applicant List"

50
00:01:50,767 --> 00:01:54,067
and you probably noticed
how quickly that loaded.

51
00:01:54,067 --> 00:01:56,534
And the page itself
actually never refreshed,

52
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:58,200
and that's thanks to GWT

53
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,801
handling the Ajax calls
to App Engine on the back end,

54
00:02:00,801 --> 00:02:02,734
pulling my data,
bringing it back up to my UI,

55
00:02:02,734 --> 00:02:04,100
and refreshing it.

56
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,467
So that makes
for an effective

57
00:02:05,467 --> 00:02:08,300
and really interactive
user experience.

58
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,701
So let's go ahead
and choose a person here

59
00:02:11,701 --> 00:02:13,801
and let's go ahead
and edit their details.

60
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:16,334
And let's say
I want to change their status

61
00:02:16,334 --> 00:02:18,667
from "New" to "Interview."

62
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:20,033
So I'm going to go ahead
and click "Save"

63
00:02:20,033 --> 00:02:22,734
and you'll see
that we were alerted

64
00:02:22,734 --> 00:02:25,767
that our changes have been
stored to the back end

65
00:02:25,767 --> 00:02:28,400
and also that our data UI
was refreshed

66
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,501
with the new information.

67
00:02:30,501 --> 00:02:34,234
So great--
we have a great, effective way

68
00:02:34,234 --> 00:02:36,601
to manage our job postings,
manage open positions,

69
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:37,968
and now how do
we get the word out

70
00:02:37,968 --> 00:02:39,601
about these job openings?

71
00:02:39,601 --> 00:02:41,334
So the first place
I'll start

72
00:02:41,334 --> 00:02:43,234
is obviously on
a company's public website.

73
00:02:43,234 --> 00:02:45,734
So in this
particular example,

74
00:02:45,734 --> 00:02:48,868
what we did was we took
the customer's website

75
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:50,667
and embedded
within the iframe

76
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:52,033
our App Engine app.

77
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:54,534
So we're able to use
GWT and App Engine

78
00:02:54,534 --> 00:02:55,801
to power this UI

79
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:58,200
which used to be
hand-coded HTML.

80
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,367
We have all of our
job openings listed here.

81
00:03:00,367 --> 00:03:02,467
We can get more detail
about a job,

82
00:03:02,467 --> 00:03:04,367
apply on the spot,

83
00:03:04,367 --> 00:03:06,767
or we can even
send it to a friend.

84
00:03:06,767 --> 00:03:08,400
And let's say
I have someone here

85
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,033
that might be interested.

86
00:03:12,033 --> 00:03:14,567
Oops.
Sorry about that.

87
00:03:14,567 --> 00:03:18,467
Let's go back.
"Email to a Friend."

88
00:03:18,467 --> 00:03:20,367
Going to send that.

89
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,734
And you'll see that,
again,

90
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:23,367
our Ajax notifications
and UI

91
00:03:23,367 --> 00:03:25,501
was all preserved
within the customer's website,

92
00:03:25,501 --> 00:03:26,834
which is very cool.

93
00:03:26,834 --> 00:03:28,634
So great--
we can now get the word out

94
00:03:28,634 --> 00:03:30,601
on our public
company website,

95
00:03:30,601 --> 00:03:31,834
but, you know,
what's a better way

96
00:03:31,834 --> 00:03:33,567
to get the word out
about these job openings?

97
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:35,133
So what we've done

98
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:37,767
is we've connected
our App Engine app--

99
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:40,634
thanks to Open Web APIs
and the cloud--

100
00:03:40,634 --> 00:03:42,501
and as soon as this loads,

101
00:03:42,501 --> 00:03:44,634
you'll see
that what we've done

102
00:03:44,634 --> 00:03:46,567
is we've connected
our job postings

103
00:03:46,567 --> 00:03:50,734
with Appirio's Facebook
Viral Recruiting app

104
00:03:50,734 --> 00:03:53,534
which connects this particular
company's employees' friends

105
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:54,868
with open job postings,

106
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:57,400
which is a great way
to get the word out.

107
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,601
So to close up,
there are three points

108
00:04:01,601 --> 00:04:04,000
that I think we wanted
to bring to the tables.

109
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,434
One, we love
the development experience.

110
00:04:06,434 --> 00:04:07,701
It was integrated--

111
00:04:07,701 --> 00:04:09,701
end-to-end Java,
GWT on the front end,

112
00:04:09,701 --> 00:04:10,868
App Engine
on the back end,

113
00:04:10,868 --> 00:04:14,100
there was no
hand-coded HTML,

114
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,667
it was cross-browser
compatible,

115
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:17,767
and we could debug
everything in Eclipse--

116
00:04:17,767 --> 00:04:19,868
end-to-end, all the way,
from data store

117
00:04:19,868 --> 00:04:21,367
up to browser.

118
00:04:21,367 --> 00:04:23,300
Two, the app is completely
in the cloud

119
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,534
without servers.

120
00:04:24,534 --> 00:04:26,968
So with no up-front
infrastructure costs,

121
00:04:26,968 --> 00:04:29,334
we were able
to get our app out there.

122
00:04:29,334 --> 00:04:31,467
And third, we now believe
that real enterprise apps

123
00:04:31,467 --> 00:04:32,801
can be built
on App Engine.

124
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:35,767
In a little time,
using Standard Java,

125
00:04:35,767 --> 00:04:37,267
we were able to build
a customer app

126
00:04:37,267 --> 00:04:38,467
and get it out there.

127
00:04:38,467 --> 00:04:40,267
So I appreciate the time.

128
00:04:40,267 --> 00:04:42,200
Thanks very much.

129
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,133
[applause]
Back to you, Kevin.
