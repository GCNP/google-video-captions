00:00:00,734 --> 00:00:01,434
Langen: My name is Casey Langen.

2
00:00:01,434 --> 00:00:03,601
I'm a software engineer
for amazon.com,

3
00:00:03,601 --> 00:00:06,534
and I wrote the Amazon MP3
Store App for Android.

4
00:00:06,534 --> 00:00:08,534
Let me show you how it works.

5
00:00:08,534 --> 00:00:10,934
So you'll notice
on the home screen

6
00:00:10,934 --> 00:00:13,701
there's easy access
to all the major features.

7
00:00:13,701 --> 00:00:16,334
There are the Top 100 Albums,
Top 100 Songs.

8
00:00:16,334 --> 00:00:17,634
These are updated hourly.

9
00:00:17,634 --> 00:00:20,200
You can Browse by Genre
or you can Search,

10
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,868
and Search is what I'll demo
for you today.

11
00:00:21,868 --> 00:00:23,934
So I'm gonna tap
the Search button,

12
00:00:23,934 --> 00:00:25,100
and I'm gonna select Hendrix.

13
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,801
I wanna look at some
Jimi Hendrix albums.

14
00:00:30,834 --> 00:00:33,567
I'm interested in purchasing
this Blues album,

15
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:35,000
so I'm going to tap it.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,567
I'll be presented with...

17
00:00:36,567 --> 00:00:38,000
an album detail page

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,801
which contains all the tracks
on the album.

19
00:00:39,801 --> 00:00:43,567
I can scroll around in here
and preview tracks in place.

20
00:00:43,567 --> 00:00:45,767
So I can just tap
Voodoo Chile Blues.

21
00:00:48,734 --> 00:00:51,467
[song playing]

22
00:00:51,467 --> 00:00:53,334
Okay, I like this song,

23
00:00:53,334 --> 00:00:54,934
so I'm gonna go ahead
and purchase it.

24
00:00:54,934 --> 00:00:57,734
So I'm going to press
this price button.

25
00:00:57,734 --> 00:00:59,634
I will tap again to confirm.

26
00:01:04,267 --> 00:01:06,133
As soon as the purchase
completes,

27
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:07,968
my downloads will be cued,

28
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:10,534
and I'll be presented
with this download screen.

29
00:01:13,734 --> 00:01:16,067
And as soon as this track
finishes downloading,

30
00:01:16,067 --> 00:01:19,834
it'll be automatically added
to the music app.

31
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:26,667
So...

32
00:01:28,334 --> 00:01:31,067
Select Albums.

33
00:01:31,067 --> 00:01:32,934
Notice here's the Blues Album.

34
00:01:32,934 --> 00:01:34,901
And here's Voodoo Chile Blues.

35
00:01:34,901 --> 00:01:39,934
[song playing]

36
00:01:42,033 --> 00:01:44,667
So that's how you use
the Amazon MP3 Store App.

37
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:47,801
Amazon is really interested
in reaching as many people

38
00:01:47,801 --> 00:01:49,667
on as many different platforms
as possible,

39
00:01:49,667 --> 00:01:52,634
so the move to the mobile market
seemed very logical.

40
00:01:52,634 --> 00:01:54,234
Android made that really easy.

41
00:01:54,234 --> 00:01:56,667
We used the Apache HTTP client

42
00:01:56,667 --> 00:01:59,567
to download metadata
from our web services.

43
00:01:59,567 --> 00:02:02,634
We use--make extensive use
of the ListView.

44
00:02:02,634 --> 00:02:04,567
In fact, I think
we use the ListView

45
00:02:04,567 --> 00:02:06,501
in every activity
in our application.

46
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,467
And we also use
the MediaPlayer quite a bit

47
00:02:09,467 --> 00:02:12,167
for song previews.
