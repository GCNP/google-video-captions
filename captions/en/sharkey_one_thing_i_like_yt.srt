Sharkey: One thing I like
about Android

2
00:00:01,634 --> 00:00:03,934
is how easy it is
to jump into the environment.

3
00:00:03,934 --> 00:00:06,567
I've been a Java developer
for the past couple years,

4
00:00:06,567 --> 00:00:08,033
and I was easily able
to jump in

5
00:00:08,033 --> 00:00:09,367
and start
writing applications,

6
00:00:09,367 --> 00:00:11,567
and get results
in just a couple minutes.

7
00:00:11,567 --> 00:00:14,400
Something I'd really like to see
from Android in the future

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,100
is the ability
to write desktop widgets,

9
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,000
so that a user
could drag and drop information

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,467
such as a weather widget,

11
00:00:19,467 --> 00:00:21,400
or maybe a stock ticker,
right onto their desktop.
