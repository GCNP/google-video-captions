00:00:01,033 --> 00:00:01,601
Abrams: One of the things
I really enjoyed

2
00:00:01,601 --> 00:00:03,200
about developing
on Android

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,634
is all the debugging support
that the platform has,

4
00:00:05,634 --> 00:00:06,968
and especially
the fact that

5
00:00:06,968 --> 00:00:08,501
the simulator
and the device

6
00:00:08,501 --> 00:00:10,133
are actually
quite similar.

7
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:12,901
You can issue similar
commands to each one.

8
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:15,267
There's a trace view
to see how your performance is,

9
00:00:15,267 --> 00:00:16,901
and there's also
the ADB shell

10
00:00:16,901 --> 00:00:19,701
to allow you to install
and uninstall, uh, your games,

11
00:00:19,701 --> 00:00:22,868
and as well as see what
processes are running right now.

12
00:00:22,868 --> 00:00:24,934
The sound support on android
is also really good.

13
00:00:24,934 --> 00:00:27,000
There's support for many
different kinds of formats.

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,634
It's easy to load them up
and play them,

15
00:00:28,634 --> 00:00:30,434
and it's quite responsive.

16
00:00:30,434 --> 00:00:31,968
So some things
I'd like to see

17
00:00:31,968 --> 00:00:33,934
to make Android development
a little bit easier

18
00:00:33,934 --> 00:00:35,801
is the ability
to store byte arrays

19
00:00:35,801 --> 00:00:37,601
into the shared preferences,

20
00:00:37,601 --> 00:00:39,400
and also the ability
to simulate

21
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,934
saving and restoring behavior,

22
00:00:40,934 --> 00:00:42,968
because the lifecycle
is very important

23
00:00:42,968 --> 00:00:44,234
to Android development.
