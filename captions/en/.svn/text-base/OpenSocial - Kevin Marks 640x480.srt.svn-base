1
00:00:13,267 --> 00:00:15,400
Marks: Hello there, I'm--

2
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,767
I've been asked
to talk to you about, um,

3
00:00:18,767 --> 00:00:20,667
the social web, um,

4
00:00:20,667 --> 00:00:24,868
and how entrepreneurs
can take advantage of that.

5
00:00:24,868 --> 00:00:29,133
So...the way--
the way I look at this

6
00:00:29,133 --> 00:00:31,133
is that, um,

7
00:00:31,133 --> 00:00:33,267
the web keeps developing
over time.

8
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:36,734
So it's--the web grew
out of an open network

9
00:00:36,734 --> 00:00:38,234
on open standards.

10
00:00:38,234 --> 00:00:41,434
Um, we built it that way
so that, um,

11
00:00:41,434 --> 00:00:43,501
you could run applications
without worrying about things.

12
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:44,834
So you didn't have
to worry about

13
00:00:44,834 --> 00:00:46,133
where other computers were,

14
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:47,734
you could just
send a message to them.

15
00:00:47,734 --> 00:00:49,434
That was the first thing
that happened.

16
00:00:49,434 --> 00:00:51,767
Um, then when we got
to the web, it was,

17
00:00:51,767 --> 00:00:54,133
"I don't have to worry
about where my documents are.

18
00:00:54,133 --> 00:00:56,067
"I can get those
from anywhere in the world.

19
00:00:56,067 --> 00:00:58,634
"Oh, and I don't have
to worry about user interfaces.

20
00:00:58,634 --> 00:01:00,734
"I can just write a form
and the form will post that

21
00:01:00,734 --> 00:01:03,133
to the other side of the world
where my server is."

22
00:01:03,133 --> 00:01:06,033
So there's increasing
abstraction over time.

23
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:07,868
Um, because these
abstractions are there,

24
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:10,567
it means, basically,
you have to write less code.

25
00:01:10,567 --> 00:01:13,367
So the trend that's been
happening over the last year,

26
00:01:13,367 --> 00:01:14,868
and the one that we've been
very involved with

27
00:01:14,868 --> 00:01:16,033
in OpenSocial,

28
00:01:16,033 --> 00:01:19,067
is coming up with abstractions
for social--

29
00:01:19,067 --> 00:01:20,701
for the social part
of the web.

30
00:01:20,701 --> 00:01:23,367
Um, a year ago,
what we saw was

31
00:01:23,367 --> 00:01:25,400
there were lots of different
social networking sites,

32
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,434
and people were spending
lots of time on them.

33
00:01:27,434 --> 00:01:29,367
But to develop for them
was very hard.

34
00:01:29,367 --> 00:01:31,400
'Cause each of them
had a separate API.

35
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,334
Um, you often had
to wedge, um, code in there

36
00:01:34,334 --> 00:01:35,801
through--through back doors

37
00:01:35,801 --> 00:01:37,667
or embedding flash
or something like that.

38
00:01:37,667 --> 00:01:39,334
So building something
that worked across many sites

39
00:01:39,334 --> 00:01:40,634
was quite hard.

40
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:43,868
Um, so we put together
the open social initiative

41
00:01:43,868 --> 00:01:45,834
to come up with a way,

42
00:01:45,834 --> 00:01:47,133
a common set of APIs

43
00:01:47,133 --> 00:01:49,267
for social applications
on the web,

44
00:01:49,267 --> 00:01:52,167
to make the social part
of the web, um,

45
00:01:52,167 --> 00:01:54,834
as easy as writing
HTML forms.

46
00:01:54,834 --> 00:01:56,767
That's the goal, to make it
something you can just

47
00:01:56,767 --> 00:01:58,367
rely on being there.

48
00:01:58,367 --> 00:02:00,300
Um, and a year on,

49
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,534
we're very excited
with what's happened with that.

50
00:02:02,534 --> 00:02:06,300
Um, I'm speaking today from
OpenSocial's first birthday.

51
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,434
Um, and we just announced
that we have

52
00:02:08,434 --> 00:02:11,200
over 600 million users
of OpenSocial worldwide,

53
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,667
across, um, most
of the countries in the world.

54
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:16,234
I can't even remember
the list of countries.

55
00:02:16,234 --> 00:02:19,634
So that's, um,
that's very exciting.

56
00:02:19,634 --> 00:02:22,534
But the point of this, really,

57
00:02:22,534 --> 00:02:26,067
is that, um, is to make
application development easier.

58
00:02:26,067 --> 00:02:28,767
At the moment, if you want
to build a social application,

59
00:02:28,767 --> 00:02:30,968
you have to find out information
about people.

60
00:02:30,968 --> 00:02:32,968
And that tends to mean
you write a large form

61
00:02:32,968 --> 00:02:34,234
for them to fill in,

62
00:02:34,234 --> 00:02:35,667
where they have to tell you
who they are,

63
00:02:35,667 --> 00:02:36,868
where they live,

64
00:02:36,868 --> 00:02:38,667
any other personal information
you need.

65
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:40,167
And then the second thing
you have to do

66
00:02:40,167 --> 00:02:41,334
to make it really social

67
00:02:41,334 --> 00:02:42,534
is find out
who their friends are

68
00:02:42,534 --> 00:02:44,167
and gather the same information
from them.

69
00:02:44,167 --> 00:02:45,934
So you either end up saying,

70
00:02:45,934 --> 00:02:47,634
"Tell me who
your friends are,"

71
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:50,567
or you--they have to re-friend
everyone on your side,

72
00:02:50,567 --> 00:02:53,667
or you go into the
"let me import your address book

73
00:02:53,667 --> 00:02:55,734
and email your friends
and tell them to join my side."

74
00:02:55,734 --> 00:02:57,567
Um, and that ends up
annoying people

75
00:02:57,567 --> 00:02:58,634
more than it helps them.

76
00:02:58,634 --> 00:02:59,968
Um, the other thing is

77
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,133
when you go to a website
that has a big form at the front

78
00:03:02,133 --> 00:03:03,434
asking for information,

79
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:05,734
people sort of back away from it
and leave.

80
00:03:05,734 --> 00:03:08,033
And so you find that what
you've got into a database

81
00:03:08,033 --> 00:03:11,267
is a sort of bad copy
of their real information

82
00:03:11,267 --> 00:03:12,400
that they store
somewhere else.

83
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,567
'Cause they're a set of sites

84
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:15,000
they actually trust
with social information.

85
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,701
'Cause those sites are--
specialize in gathering.

86
00:03:17,701 --> 00:03:21,300
So, um, what you're
able to do with OpenSocial

87
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,067
is to draw on those
existing sites

88
00:03:23,067 --> 00:03:24,634
that have
these large collections

89
00:03:24,634 --> 00:03:25,901
of social data,

90
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:27,200
um, build your application

91
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,167
that specializes
in what you want to do,

92
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,200
um, and then take advantage

93
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,934
of the social network
that already exists.

94
00:03:32,934 --> 00:03:35,200
So you can...whatever
your application's about,

95
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,501
you can almost always
enhance it

96
00:03:36,501 --> 00:03:37,734
by making it more social,

97
00:03:37,734 --> 00:03:39,968
by making it something
you do with friends.

98
00:03:39,968 --> 00:03:42,701
Even if it's just a,
um, a news site

99
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:44,133
that's telling stories,

100
00:03:44,133 --> 00:03:46,133
um, you can be more
interesting stories

101
00:03:46,133 --> 00:03:49,000
that your friends have
read or recommended,

102
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,701
um, than--than you are
in general

103
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:53,634
the stories that--that
everyone's looking at.

104
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:57,200
So by--just by adding that
little social feedback loop,

105
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,167
you can make each, um,
each experience

106
00:04:00,167 --> 00:04:03,634
more interesting.

107
00:04:03,634 --> 00:04:06,467
Um, so another
aspect of this--

108
00:04:06,467 --> 00:04:08,534
now, there--there's--

109
00:04:08,534 --> 00:04:10,767
in building
social applications,

110
00:04:10,767 --> 00:04:12,834
there's a lot of talk
about becoming viral

111
00:04:12,834 --> 00:04:14,467
and spreading.

112
00:04:14,467 --> 00:04:16,901
And--and there's--there's been
a set of applications built

113
00:04:16,901 --> 00:04:18,367
whose primary goal

114
00:04:18,367 --> 00:04:20,400
is to get as many members
as possible.

115
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,567
Um, and this is--
this--this is--

116
00:04:22,567 --> 00:04:24,934
there's, you know, we're seeing
a backlash against that.

117
00:04:24,934 --> 00:04:26,934
And what I like to argue
is that this is--

118
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:29,033
this is because people
are using the wrong metaphor.

119
00:04:29,033 --> 00:04:31,234
If you think of yourself
as a virus,

120
00:04:31,234 --> 00:04:32,234
you're basically saying,

121
00:04:32,234 --> 00:04:33,734
"I would like
to be a disease.

122
00:04:33,734 --> 00:04:36,000
"I would like to take advantage
or people to spread myself,

123
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,801
and that's my only goal
in life."

124
00:04:37,801 --> 00:04:40,534
So what I say people do
is think of different metaphors.

125
00:04:40,534 --> 00:04:42,367
Think of organic metaphors.

126
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:46,167
Um, think instead
of infecting someone,

127
00:04:46,167 --> 00:04:47,434
think of inviting them.

128
00:04:47,434 --> 00:04:49,167
Um, so think
of how plants work.

129
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:50,334
Plants have fruit.

130
00:04:50,334 --> 00:04:51,934
A fruit is a seed,

131
00:04:51,934 --> 00:04:54,000
but it has something delicious
wrapped around it.

132
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,567
If you send someone
an invitation

133
00:04:55,567 --> 00:04:57,334
that actually
makes them happy,

134
00:04:57,334 --> 00:04:58,634
they're much more likely
to follow through,

135
00:04:58,634 --> 00:05:00,467
plant the seed,
and grow it. 

136
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:03,601
So if you se--rather than
sending out invitations

137
00:05:03,601 --> 00:05:05,267
to everyone
in the address book,

138
00:05:05,267 --> 00:05:07,400
um, if you let people

139
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,534
send out photographs
of people,

140
00:05:09,534 --> 00:05:11,033
um, that contain them,

141
00:05:11,033 --> 00:05:12,300
they're much more likely
to look at it.

142
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,434
If I get an email with

143
00:05:13,434 --> 00:05:15,300
"Your friend has
a photograph of you,"

144
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,267
um, I'm gonna look at that,
go back, and click on that.

145
00:05:18,267 --> 00:05:20,367
So think about how you can
actually spread this stuff

146
00:05:20,367 --> 00:05:22,534
so it's a natural part
of the experience

147
00:05:22,534 --> 00:05:25,634
rather than something
you're exploiting

148
00:05:25,634 --> 00:05:27,467
for your--for your own ends.

149
00:05:27,467 --> 00:05:29,434
Because if you behave
like a disease,

150
00:05:29,434 --> 00:05:30,901
people develop
an immune system,

151
00:05:30,901 --> 00:05:33,100
and they learn to reject you,
your applications.

152
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,834
And that's something
we're seeing now.

153
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,234
Um, the applications
that spread rapidly

154
00:05:37,234 --> 00:05:39,167
go up like this,
and they collapse like that

155
00:05:39,167 --> 00:05:40,601
as people start
uninstalling them

156
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:43,133
and as containers
start banning them.

157
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:44,801
Um, I said container there,

158
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:47,000
so I should back up
and explain that a little bit.

159
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,167
Um, with OpenSocial,
we split the development world

160
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:53,601
into what we call containers
and applications.

161
00:05:53,601 --> 00:05:54,801
The idea is the container

162
00:05:54,801 --> 00:05:56,400
is the custodian
of the social data.

163
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,667
It's the place that knows
who your friends are,

164
00:05:58,667 --> 00:06:00,300
has information
about you and them,

165
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,267
and can reveal that
to the application.

166
00:06:02,267 --> 00:06:03,934
Now, clearly,
they have to do that

167
00:06:03,934 --> 00:06:05,701
with permission
of the users.

168
00:06:05,701 --> 00:06:07,167
So there are
three people involved.

169
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:08,534
There's the container,
the application,

170
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:09,701
and the user.

171
00:06:09,701 --> 00:06:11,300
Um, and the user chooses
which applications

172
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,667
to add to the container,

173
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:14,701
and the container manages
the personal information

174
00:06:14,701 --> 00:06:16,667
so the application doesn't
have to worry about that.

175
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,467
Um, and also, the other--

176
00:06:18,467 --> 00:06:21,834
the key thing,
the value that, um,

177
00:06:21,834 --> 00:06:24,067
the application
gets from the container

178
00:06:24,067 --> 00:06:27,067
is the friends of the user
can see that application too,

179
00:06:27,067 --> 00:06:28,868
and they can learn
to install it.

180
00:06:28,868 --> 00:06:32,200
So it can spread,
um, rapidly in that way.

181
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,000
But, as I say,
you shouldn't be focusing

182
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,300
on spread as your goal.

183
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,133
You should be focusing
on delighting the users

184
00:06:37,133 --> 00:06:38,567
so they want it to spread,

185
00:06:38,567 --> 00:06:40,601
rather than they feel like
something's taking them over

186
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:43,501
and exploiting them.

187
00:06:43,501 --> 00:06:45,801
Um...the--

188
00:06:45,801 --> 00:06:48,167
so the other thing
that I want to mention

189
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:49,667
about the growth of OpenSocial

190
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:51,267
and the way it's changed
in the last year,

191
00:06:51,267 --> 00:06:54,701
um, up until recently,

192
00:06:54,701 --> 00:06:55,868
the model for OpenSocial

193
00:06:55,868 --> 00:06:57,701
has been literally
having an application

194
00:06:57,701 --> 00:06:59,667
embedded inside
somebody else's site.

195
00:06:59,667 --> 00:07:01,667
So if you've got
the container site,

196
00:07:01,667 --> 00:07:04,033
the application was part
of their page.

197
00:07:04,033 --> 00:07:06,300
Um, this has some advantages.

198
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,334
It makes the context
very clear to the user.

199
00:07:08,334 --> 00:07:10,734
It makes it easier
to integrate, um,

200
00:07:10,734 --> 00:07:12,100
the--the friend stuff

201
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,801
'cause it's fairly clear
what's going on.

202
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:15,834
But the drawback is that, um,

203
00:07:15,834 --> 00:07:17,901
you have to write it
in JavaScript.

204
00:07:17,901 --> 00:07:20,067
Um, and...

205
00:07:20,067 --> 00:07:21,868
well, you can write some
in CSS as well,

206
00:07:21,868 --> 00:07:24,200
but primarily, you're writing
JavaScript application.

207
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,734
Um, and plus
your application

208
00:07:25,734 --> 00:07:29,000
can only actually run code
when somebody's looking at it.

209
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,567
So one of the things
we added in OpenSocial.8

210
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:34,167
is a REST API,

211
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:36,133
which makes it easier
for you to write

212
00:07:36,133 --> 00:07:38,667
your application
on your own server over here,

213
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,167
and call
into the social network,

214
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:41,934
um, use the information
from there,

215
00:07:41,934 --> 00:07:43,501
and present that
back to the user there.

216
00:07:43,501 --> 00:07:46,834
So what we use is a set
of open protocols for that.

217
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:49,267
We use, um, REST,

218
00:07:49,267 --> 00:07:51,901
which is the basic standard
for communicating on the web.

219
00:07:51,901 --> 00:07:55,100
We use OAuth
to authenticate that,

220
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,033
um, and to let the user say,

221
00:07:57,033 --> 00:07:58,801
"Yes, this application's
allowed to do something

222
00:07:58,801 --> 00:08:00,200
with my application."

223
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,567
Um, and the three parts
of OpenSocial are--

224
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:05,434
well, actually, there's
four parts of OpenSocial

225
00:08:05,434 --> 00:08:07,067
that are exposed
with REST APIs.

226
00:08:07,067 --> 00:08:09,534
The first is the people
and contact stuff,

227
00:08:09,534 --> 00:08:11,067
finding out who you are,
who your friends are,

228
00:08:11,067 --> 00:08:12,400
and information about you.

229
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,701
Um, the second
is data persistence.

230
00:08:14,701 --> 00:08:16,801
You can actually store data
within the container,

231
00:08:16,801 --> 00:08:18,901
which means when the app
is running in the container,

232
00:08:18,901 --> 00:08:21,033
it can have access
to that quickly.

233
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:23,834
And also, it handles
the hard problem

234
00:08:23,834 --> 00:08:25,868
of I'm storing information
for user--

235
00:08:25,868 --> 00:08:26,968
for one user.

236
00:08:26,968 --> 00:08:28,300
I need the information
for that user

237
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,567
plus his friends.

238
00:08:29,567 --> 00:08:31,601
Um, for a large number
of users,

239
00:08:31,601 --> 00:08:33,467
that's actually quite
a hard database problem.

240
00:08:33,467 --> 00:08:35,133
But the social networks
have already sold that

241
00:08:35,133 --> 00:08:37,234
because they already have
large numbers of users,

242
00:08:37,234 --> 00:08:38,834
and they solve that problem
every day.

243
00:08:38,834 --> 00:08:40,234
So you're basically
piggybacking

244
00:08:40,234 --> 00:08:42,000
on their ability
to do that there.

245
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,601
The third one
is activity streams.

246
00:08:44,601 --> 00:08:46,801
Now, this is the page
where you have a list

247
00:08:46,801 --> 00:08:48,267
of what you and your friends
have done

248
00:08:48,267 --> 00:08:50,601
within the--
the social network site.

249
00:08:50,601 --> 00:08:52,467
That's been extended
with OpenSocial

250
00:08:52,467 --> 00:08:54,133
so that anything you do
with the applications

251
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:55,734
could show up in there too.

252
00:08:55,734 --> 00:08:59,167
And with .8, you can
run an application remotely

253
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:01,033
and send activities
into the site.

254
00:09:01,033 --> 00:09:02,734
So if they do something
on your site,

255
00:09:02,734 --> 00:09:04,634
their friends on the social
network can see that too.

256
00:09:04,634 --> 00:09:06,634
And again, it adds value
for everyone.

257
00:09:06,634 --> 00:09:08,834
It adds value for you
because the social network

258
00:09:08,834 --> 00:09:11,834
where people are watching and
loading the pages 20 times a day

259
00:09:11,834 --> 00:09:13,934
has information
about your applications.

260
00:09:13,934 --> 00:09:16,667
It adds value for, um,
for social network

261
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:19,100
because stuff that's
happening elsewhere is--

262
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,400
becomes part
of their world.

263
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,734
And it adds value
for the people

264
00:09:21,734 --> 00:09:23,334
'cause they can
keep track of their friends.

265
00:09:23,334 --> 00:09:25,167
So again, you know, you have
this ability to do this.

266
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:26,734
You could abuse that
and fill it with noise,

267
00:09:26,734 --> 00:09:28,767
but if you do, you'll get
shut down fairly quickly.

268
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:30,634
So think about how
you can keep that

269
00:09:30,634 --> 00:09:32,434
in a way that adds value
to all three.

270
00:09:32,434 --> 00:09:33,934
Then the fourth thing
is messaging.

271
00:09:33,934 --> 00:09:35,434
You can send messages
to people

272
00:09:35,434 --> 00:09:36,734
through the social network.

273
00:09:36,734 --> 00:09:39,200
Um, and this is--
this is, um, valuable

274
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,734
in that there is
a large group of people

275
00:09:41,734 --> 00:09:43,601
who have moved
from using email

276
00:09:43,601 --> 00:09:45,234
as their primary
messaging system

277
00:09:45,234 --> 00:09:46,901
to using social networks
for that.

278
00:09:46,901 --> 00:09:49,033
Because this--explicitly
because the social networks

279
00:09:49,033 --> 00:09:50,167
are whitelisted.

280
00:09:50,167 --> 00:09:52,567
So if your application
has gained trust

281
00:09:52,567 --> 00:09:53,767
of both parties,

282
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:55,200
it can send messages
between them.

283
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,634
And that--that makes that
more useful for them too.

284
00:09:57,634 --> 00:10:00,267
So the mod--the model here

285
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:04,033
is very much adding new
infrastructure to the web

286
00:10:04,033 --> 00:10:06,901
such that every application
you make can become social.

287
00:10:06,901 --> 00:10:08,601
Um, the other, think way
of looking at it

288
00:10:08,601 --> 00:10:09,901
is it's freeing you

289
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,434
from having to maintain
that database of users.

290
00:10:12,434 --> 00:10:14,100
One of the things
you often have to do

291
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,467
in doing web applications
is say,

292
00:10:15,467 --> 00:10:16,834
"Okay, your user database.

293
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:18,868
I need to start collecting
this stuff."

294
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,067
And it's a sort of bunch
of extra make work

295
00:10:21,067 --> 00:10:22,367
you have to do
at the beginning

296
00:10:22,367 --> 00:10:24,334
before you can focus on
what you really want to build.

297
00:10:24,334 --> 00:10:26,834
So this means that you can
delegate that to other sites

298
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:30,434
and not worry about, um,
how that works.

299
00:10:30,434 --> 00:10:32,400
And that's--
that's a strong piece

300
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,334
of the, um, what
we're calling the...

301
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:38,801
um, open stack
of standard protocol

302
00:10:38,801 --> 00:10:40,501
that's for connecting
between sites.

303
00:10:40,501 --> 00:10:43,367
Um, there's--there's a set
of these,

304
00:10:43,367 --> 00:10:44,667
and I won't go
into every place--

305
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:47,801
OpenID, OAuth,
and OpenSocial

306
00:10:47,801 --> 00:10:49,434
are the three
key ones to know about.

307
00:10:49,434 --> 00:10:52,467
OpenID means using
another site's URL

308
00:10:52,467 --> 00:10:54,601
as a login instead
of an email address.

309
00:10:54,601 --> 00:10:57,734
OAuth means getting
authorization--

310
00:10:57,734 --> 00:10:59,000
letting you use
a grant permission

311
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,934
to access another site
in a standardized way.

312
00:11:01,934 --> 00:11:04,434
And then OpenSocial
is the specification

313
00:11:04,434 --> 00:11:06,834
that defines
what kind of data

314
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:08,634
you're exchanging
over these connections.

315
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:11,167
And also has the connection
to the gadget model

316
00:11:11,167 --> 00:11:13,167
so you can actually embed
an application

317
00:11:13,167 --> 00:11:16,467
entirely inside
another site as well.

318
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,567
Man: Great.

319
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:18,767
- Kevin: Okay.
- Man: Nice job.

320
00:11:18,767 --> 00:11:20,601
Kevin: How long was that?
