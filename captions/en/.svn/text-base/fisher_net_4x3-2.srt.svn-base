00:00:05,601 --> 00:00:06,801
Fisher: I'm Jeff Fisher,

2
00:00:06,801 --> 00:00:08,434
and this is a short
introductory video

3
00:00:08,434 --> 00:00:12,033
on using the .Net Client Library
Google Data APIs.

4
00:00:12,033 --> 00:00:13,767
Let's get started.

5
00:00:13,767 --> 00:00:16,234
First, you have to download
the SDK

6
00:00:16,234 --> 00:00:20,033
from our code.google.com page
at this URL.

7
00:00:20,033 --> 00:00:24,200
I've already downloaded the SDK,
so let's install it.

8
00:00:30,601 --> 00:00:33,634
For this demo, I'm using
Microsoft Visual C#

9
00:00:33,634 --> 00:00:35,634
2008 Express Edition,
which is free

10
00:00:35,634 --> 00:00:37,467
and a good way to get started.

11
00:00:37,467 --> 00:00:40,767
However, the SDK assumes
we're using Visual Studio 2005,

12
00:00:40,767 --> 00:00:43,567
so we have to copy
the Project Templates.

13
00:00:43,567 --> 00:00:46,167
If you're using
Visual Studio 2005,

14
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:48,534
you don't have to do this step.

15
00:00:54,634 --> 00:00:55,901
Now that we've done that,

16
00:00:55,901 --> 00:00:58,100
we can go ahead
and open Visual Studio.

17
00:01:03,334 --> 00:01:06,300
Since we have these Templates,
printing a new project is easy.

18
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,801
First go to New Project.

19
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:11,067
We can create
a Google Picasa project

20
00:01:11,067 --> 00:01:13,734
with one click.

21
00:01:13,734 --> 00:01:18,334
This creates a new blank project
with some code for us.

22
00:01:18,334 --> 00:01:22,100
It also creates a dialogue box
for the user to log in.

23
00:01:24,968 --> 00:01:26,367
If you look at the code
behind this,

24
00:01:26,367 --> 00:01:28,767
we first discuss some
of the high level principles

25
00:01:28,767 --> 00:01:30,367
of our Client Library.

26
00:01:30,367 --> 00:01:33,767
The Client Library is organized
into the following components.

27
00:01:33,767 --> 00:01:35,267
There is the Service Class,

28
00:01:35,267 --> 00:01:37,501
which deals with the connection
to the API.

29
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:40,000
There are Query Classes
which allow us to construct

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,267
particular queries
against the API.

31
00:01:42,267 --> 00:01:44,300
And there are also
Feed and Entry Classes

32
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,868
that contain the data model.

33
00:01:45,868 --> 00:01:47,334
In this simple example,

34
00:01:47,334 --> 00:01:49,701
we first create
a new service class.

35
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,968
Then we get our log-in
information

36
00:01:53,968 --> 00:01:56,000
from the form provided
by the template.

37
00:01:57,934 --> 00:02:00,868
And then we're able to create
a new AlbumQuery.

38
00:02:04,334 --> 00:02:07,234
Then we get back a feed
of all the users' albums.

39
00:02:07,234 --> 00:02:09,968
Looping through this feed
gives us a number of entries

40
00:02:09,968 --> 00:02:11,767
which contain information
about each album

41
00:02:11,767 --> 00:02:13,567
that the user has.

42
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:15,934
We are then able to update
a GUI element

43
00:02:15,934 --> 00:02:17,734
with information
about these albums

44
00:02:17,734 --> 00:02:19,534
and display it to the user.

45
00:02:19,534 --> 00:02:21,868
Let's run this example.

46
00:02:23,501 --> 00:02:26,334
First I have to log in.

47
00:02:30,334 --> 00:02:33,300
And now you can see each
of the albums in my test account

48
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,934
along with the number of photos
that are in each album.

49
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:39,934
That's a simple way
to get started.

50
00:02:39,934 --> 00:02:43,467
But perhaps you want a more
detailed code example to copy.

51
00:02:46,534 --> 00:02:50,200
For that, we can go
into the SDK directory

52
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,367
in our start menu
and open up the Sample solution.

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,133
Again,
since we're using 2008,

54
00:02:59,133 --> 00:03:02,734
we have to quickly convert
the existing solution.

55
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:07,901
Now that we've done that,
we can see that there are

56
00:03:07,901 --> 00:03:10,868
a number of samples
provided for us.

57
00:03:10,868 --> 00:03:13,901
The first one I'd like to show
is the Photo Browser.

58
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:17,133
This is an advanced form
of the demo that we saw earlier.

59
00:03:25,267 --> 00:03:27,634
Again, we have to log in.

60
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:36,701
Again, we see the list
of albums,

61
00:03:36,701 --> 00:03:38,801
but this time,
we can see the album cover

62
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:43,067
and double-click to see
each photo inside of the album.

63
00:03:43,067 --> 00:03:45,200
All of this code
is open source

64
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,901
and available for you to use
in your own applications.

65
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:51,901
One other sample
I'd like to show you

66
00:03:51,901 --> 00:03:53,133
is the DocList Uploader.

67
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:56,434
Go ahead and set this
as a StartUp Project.

68
00:04:00,534 --> 00:04:04,567
This sample allows us to quickly
log in to Google Docs...

69
00:04:09,067 --> 00:04:11,534
See our existing Docs,
open them,

70
00:04:11,534 --> 00:04:14,200
and also upload new ones
by dragging and dropping.

71
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,634
Again, this sample
is Open Source,

72
00:04:16,634 --> 00:04:18,400
and you can see
all of the code.

73
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,534
Now that we've gone through
some of the samples

74
00:04:23,534 --> 00:04:25,734
and gotten you started
compiling your own application,

75
00:04:25,734 --> 00:04:28,067
let's talk about some of
the resources that are available

76
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:30,133
to help you develop.

77
00:04:30,133 --> 00:04:31,667
All of our resources
are available

78
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:33,467
on code.google.com

79
00:04:33,467 --> 00:04:36,767
starting at the Project Page
of the .net Client Library.

80
00:04:36,767 --> 00:04:38,834
Besides downloading the SDK,

81
00:04:38,834 --> 00:04:42,400
you can also view
the documentation.

82
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,734
The documentation includes
a Javadoc style reference

83
00:04:45,734 --> 00:04:50,567
for all of the classes,
members, constructors...

84
00:04:50,567 --> 00:04:53,734
and objects used
in the Client Library.

85
00:04:57,667 --> 00:05:00,467
We also have a number
of Developer Guides

86
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,334
for each particular API

87
00:05:02,334 --> 00:05:04,734
that walk you through
each operation

88
00:05:04,734 --> 00:05:06,734
that can be performed.

89
00:05:08,534 --> 00:05:09,901
Lastly, if you have
any questions,

90
00:05:09,901 --> 00:05:13,701
we have a discussion group
available

91
00:05:13,701 --> 00:05:15,868
for you to ask any questions,
concerns,

92
00:05:15,868 --> 00:05:18,767
or request any features that
are not currently available.

93
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:20,601
Thanks for watching this video.

94
00:05:20,601 --> 00:05:23,000
I hope that you'll create
some interesting applications

95
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,801
and share them with us.
