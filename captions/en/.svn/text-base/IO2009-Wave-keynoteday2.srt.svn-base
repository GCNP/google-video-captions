00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:02,734
man:
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:02,734 --> 00:00:07,300
please welcome Vice President,
Engineering, Vic Gundotra.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:11,334
[cheers and applause]

4
00:00:11,334 --> 00:00:13,300
Gundotra:
Well, good morning, everyone.

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,200
Welcome to day two
of Google I/O.

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,267
I hope you all had
a great time yesterday.

7
00:00:18,267 --> 00:00:20,067
I hope you enjoyed
your sessions,

8
00:00:20,067 --> 00:00:23,200
and I hope you enjoyed
those Android phones.

9
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,701
[audience whoos]

10
00:00:24,701 --> 00:00:29,400
[cheers and applause]

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,767
Yesterday, we promised you
a surprise for this morning.

12
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:37,167
And this morning,
Google will surprise you.

13
00:00:37,167 --> 00:00:39,701
We are about to unveil

14
00:00:39,701 --> 00:00:43,133
a personal communication
and collaboration tool

15
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:45,634
in a very early form.

16
00:00:45,634 --> 00:00:48,200
We decided to do this
at this forum

17
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,834
for a couple of reasons.

18
00:00:49,834 --> 00:00:51,701
This unbelievable product,

19
00:00:51,701 --> 00:00:54,467
one that I'm very,
very excited about,

20
00:00:54,467 --> 00:00:57,100
will be open-sourced.

21
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,434
It's open-sourced
for many reasons.

22
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,534
Not only do we want to
contribute to the Internet,

23
00:01:01,534 --> 00:01:03,534
but frankly,
we need developers

24
00:01:03,534 --> 00:01:05,534
to help us
complete this product,

25
00:01:05,534 --> 00:01:06,667
and we need your support.

26
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:08,534
So we hope after
you see this

27
00:01:08,534 --> 00:01:11,133
you're as excited
about it as we are.

28
00:01:11,133 --> 00:01:13,033
And number two,

29
00:01:13,033 --> 00:01:15,334
we decided to unveil
this product

30
00:01:15,334 --> 00:01:17,701
in its early form
at this conference

31
00:01:17,701 --> 00:01:20,968
because it is an unbelievable,
powerful demonstration

32
00:01:20,968 --> 00:01:23,634
of what is possible
in the browser.

33
00:01:23,634 --> 00:01:26,334
I guarantee you that over
the next hour and a half,

34
00:01:26,334 --> 00:01:29,601
as you see this product,
you will forget

35
00:01:29,601 --> 00:01:31,467
that you are looking
at the browser.

36
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:33,467
And I want you
to repeat after me.

37
00:01:33,467 --> 00:01:36,033
"I am looking
at an HTML 5 app.

38
00:01:36,033 --> 00:01:39,000
I am looking at what's
possible in the browser."

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,334
And I hope you are as excited
and delighted as I was

40
00:01:43,334 --> 00:01:46,400
when I first saw the thinking
behind this product.

41
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,667
Now, it shouldn't
have surprised me

42
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:50,567
that this product
would be magical.

43
00:01:50,567 --> 00:01:53,200
After all,
the engineering leadership

44
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,868
had already produced
a magical product.

45
00:01:55,868 --> 00:01:59,133
The engineering leadership
behind what you're about to see

46
00:01:59,133 --> 00:02:01,067
is the work
of two brothers,

47
00:02:01,067 --> 00:02:03,200
and an amazing
engineering team with them.

48
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,434
Those two brothers
are Lars and Jens Rasmussen.

49
00:02:07,434 --> 00:02:09,234
You might remember
those names,

50
00:02:09,234 --> 00:02:12,033
because those were
the same amazing people

51
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:16,133
that did another magical app
called Maps--Google Maps.

52
00:02:16,133 --> 00:02:18,100
And so you'll see what
they've been working on

53
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,000
unveiled for
the first time today.

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,834
So why don't we go ahead
and get started?

55
00:02:21,834 --> 00:02:24,834
Remember, this is
an early developer preview

56
00:02:24,834 --> 00:02:26,334
for this audience.

57
00:02:26,334 --> 00:02:30,300
Everyone in this room will get
accounts to give us feedback,

58
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,200
and we'll talk about that
a little bit later.

59
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,033
We have your email addresses,
so you will get those passwords

60
00:02:35,033 --> 00:02:37,467
a little bit later on,
likely tomorrow.

61
00:02:37,467 --> 00:02:39,634
With that, let me just
go ahead and get started.

62
00:02:39,634 --> 00:02:43,400
Let me introduce Lars Rasmussen
and Stephanie Hannon.

63
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,100
Thank you.

64
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,634
[cheers and applause]

65
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:48,701
Lars Rasmussen:
Thank you.

66
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:51,267
Thank you.
Thank you.

67
00:02:54,367 --> 00:02:56,367
Thank you very much.

68
00:02:56,367 --> 00:03:00,033
I shall wake up
my laptop.

69
00:03:00,033 --> 00:03:02,067
Good morning, everyone.

70
00:03:02,067 --> 00:03:03,400
Thank you very much
for coming early.

71
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,000
I know you've been here
partying all night.

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,767
Uh, we're going
to show a demo today

73
00:03:07,767 --> 00:03:09,367
of a product that
we've been working on

74
00:03:09,367 --> 00:03:12,133
for a couple of years
down in Sydney, Australia.

75
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:15,634
It's called Google Wave,

76
00:03:15,634 --> 00:03:18,334
and it's a communication
and collaborations tool

77
00:03:18,334 --> 00:03:20,434
that we're launching
later in the year.

78
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:22,901
Uh, like Vic said,
it's a little unusual for us

79
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:25,234
to be showing it
to the world this early.

80
00:03:25,234 --> 00:03:27,234
The reason we're doing it
is very simple.

81
00:03:27,234 --> 00:03:30,200
We're starting
a developer preview today.

82
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,567
You guys will all
get accounts

83
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:33,567
on a sandbox build
of the system.

84
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:36,467
You are the first outside
of Google to see this,

85
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:39,734
and you'll be the first
to get accounts on the system.

86
00:03:39,734 --> 00:03:43,033
And we're doing that because
as you will see from the demo,

87
00:03:43,033 --> 00:03:45,934
Google Wave comes with a set
of really nice APIs,

88
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,968
and we're hoping we can
persuade you guys

89
00:03:47,968 --> 00:03:51,767
to start building cool things
with those APIs

90
00:03:51,767 --> 00:03:54,334
while we're getting
the product ready for launch,

91
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,434
which is going to happen
later this year.

92
00:03:56,434 --> 00:03:58,267
Because that way,
when we do launch,

93
00:03:58,267 --> 00:04:01,567
our users and your users
can enjoy both Google Waves

94
00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:04,334
and all the cool things
that we hope you'll build

95
00:04:04,334 --> 00:04:05,868
at the same time.

96
00:04:05,868 --> 00:04:07,567
Let me introduce
Stephanie Hannon.

97
00:04:07,567 --> 00:04:10,968
She's quite possibly
the best PM in the world.

98
00:04:10,968 --> 00:04:12,501
[cheers and applause]

99
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:14,234
Hannon: [laughs]

100
00:04:16,534 --> 00:04:18,701
Good morning, I/O.

101
00:04:18,701 --> 00:04:20,801
Thank you, Vic,
for the invitation to be here.

102
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:22,834
We couldn't imagine
a better audience

103
00:04:22,834 --> 00:04:24,868
to show our
product to first.

104
00:04:24,868 --> 00:04:26,701
Lars Rasmussen:
I second that.

105
00:04:26,701 --> 00:04:29,734
Hannon: Our presentation
today is in three parts.

106
00:04:29,734 --> 00:04:31,934
First, we're going to show you
a demo of the product.

107
00:04:31,934 --> 00:04:35,434
Second, we'll show you the APIs
that Lars talked about.

108
00:04:35,434 --> 00:04:38,701
You can use Waves
to enhance your Web site

109
00:04:38,701 --> 00:04:41,834
and you can build
extensions to Wave itself.

110
00:04:41,834 --> 00:04:44,968
Third, we'll show you
that Wave is also a protocol.

111
00:04:44,968 --> 00:04:46,968
We are very passionate
about this being

112
00:04:46,968 --> 00:04:49,167
an open system
of communication.

113
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:51,434
We hope other people
build Wave services

114
00:04:51,434 --> 00:04:53,400
that interoperate
with ours

115
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,767
so users have choice
in their provider.

116
00:04:55,767 --> 00:04:59,167
We affectionately
call this the three Ps.

117
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:01,901
Product, platform, protocol.

118
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:04,033
And we'll talk
about them all today.

119
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:07,367
Lars Rasmussen:
Okay, so communication.

120
00:05:07,367 --> 00:05:10,133
Um, email today is by far
the most popular way

121
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:11,834
for us to communicate
on the Internet,

122
00:05:11,834 --> 00:05:13,434
which is remarkable,

123
00:05:13,434 --> 00:05:16,334
because email was invented
more than 40 years ago.

124
00:05:16,334 --> 00:05:19,234
before the Internet,
before the Web,

125
00:05:19,234 --> 00:05:21,968
and it was done
without the experience

126
00:05:21,968 --> 00:05:24,634
of things like SMS,
and instant messenging,

127
00:05:24,634 --> 00:05:26,901
and blogs, and Wikis,
and bulletin boards,

128
00:05:26,901 --> 00:05:29,801
and discussion groups,
and social networks, and Wikis,

129
00:05:29,801 --> 00:05:33,100
and media sharing sites,
and collaborative editors--

130
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,300
All of these different
kinds of communication

131
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,901
that we take
for granted today.

132
00:05:37,901 --> 00:05:40,601
Also, of course,
computers and networks

133
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:43,400
have dramatically improved
in those four decades,

134
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,200
and so when we started
this project--

135
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,934
and it's been
more than two years--

136
00:05:47,934 --> 00:05:49,501
we asked ourselves
the question,

137
00:05:49,501 --> 00:05:53,000
"what might email look like
if it was invented today?"

138
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,834
And needless to say,
there is about a million

139
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:57,400
different ways you can
answer that question.

140
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,634
What you're going to see today,
Google Wave, is our attempt.

141
00:06:01,634 --> 00:06:04,267
And so let me start
by briefly contrasting

142
00:06:04,267 --> 00:06:06,334
email from Wave.

143
00:06:06,334 --> 00:06:09,300
Email essentially
mimics snail mail.

144
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,901
The basic metaphor
is you write a message

145
00:06:11,901 --> 00:06:14,100
and you send it
to one or more recipients,

146
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,734
and then email systems--

147
00:06:15,734 --> 00:06:18,834
and we like to think Gmail
does this particularly well--

148
00:06:18,834 --> 00:06:24,400
can collate related messages
into conversations or threads.

149
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,000
Wave, by contrast,
starts out

150
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,634
with the definition
of a conversation,

151
00:06:29,634 --> 00:06:32,334
which is simply a lightweight
tree structure of messages

152
00:06:32,334 --> 00:06:35,701
and a set of users participating
in that conversation.

153
00:06:35,701 --> 00:06:38,501
And then instead of thinking
of individual messages

154
00:06:38,501 --> 00:06:40,567
as being sent
back and forth,

155
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,801
we think of the entire
conversation object

156
00:06:42,801 --> 00:06:46,567
as being a shared object
hosted on a server somewhere.

157
00:06:46,567 --> 00:06:50,000
And users that participate
can open up that wave,

158
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,501
leave their replies,
go away,

159
00:06:52,501 --> 00:06:54,267
and then when
the next user comes,

160
00:06:54,267 --> 00:06:57,100
she can open up
that same shared object,

161
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,400
see those replies,
and add her own.

162
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,634
That's how the wave grows.

163
00:07:00,634 --> 00:07:02,801
That's how the conversation
builds up.

164
00:07:02,801 --> 00:07:05,133
And you'll recognize
that this is a model

165
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,033
that came to how
bulletin boards work.

166
00:07:07,033 --> 00:07:09,734
We found that with a tight
enough implementation,

167
00:07:09,734 --> 00:07:12,701
you can use that to build
a single communication tool

168
00:07:12,701 --> 00:07:15,934
that has functionality
spanning quite a lot further

169
00:07:15,934 --> 00:07:18,968
than what you can do
with email today.

170
00:07:18,968 --> 00:07:20,734
And so we'll show you a demo.

171
00:07:20,734 --> 00:07:24,234
It'll take you through
a series of usage scenarios

172
00:07:24,234 --> 00:07:25,767
that you'll be
familiar with,

173
00:07:25,767 --> 00:07:29,734
but where today we would use
different tools for each one,

174
00:07:29,734 --> 00:07:31,400
and we'll show you
how it all fits neatly

175
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,834
in this one metaphor
of hosted conversations.

176
00:07:33,834 --> 00:07:35,167
Stephanie.

177
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:38,434
Hannon: So what you are
looking at is an HTML 5 app

178
00:07:38,434 --> 00:07:40,634
that we built with
the Google Web Toolkit.

179
00:07:40,634 --> 00:07:43,434
On the left side
is Lars running Chrome.

180
00:07:43,434 --> 00:07:46,167
On the right side,
I'm running Safari.

181
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:48,968
And a little bit later
we're going to throw in Firefox.

182
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,400
So the same thing is being shown
on each pair of screens,

183
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,567
you can just
choose one to look at.

184
00:07:54,567 --> 00:07:56,033
Lars Rasmussen:
Okay, so we'll start

185
00:07:56,033 --> 00:07:59,167
with plain vanilla-type
email conversations,

186
00:07:59,167 --> 00:08:02,400
and we'll show you
how it looks in Wave.

187
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,200
We're planning
a boat trip.

188
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,100
And I'm going to start
by clicking "New Wave" here,

189
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,434
and then I'll type my title
in the first line.

190
00:08:08,434 --> 00:08:09,767
Hannon: Watch your
spelling, Lars.

191
00:08:09,767 --> 00:08:11,100
There's a lot of people.

192
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,434
Lars Rasmussen: [laughs]
There is a lot of people.

193
00:08:12,434 --> 00:08:14,667
They can't see
what I'm typing anyway.

194
00:08:14,667 --> 00:08:18,534
"Are you ready
for the boat trip?

195
00:08:18,534 --> 00:08:20,033
Hey, Steph."

196
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:22,634
Did you guys like
the spell-checker?

197
00:08:22,634 --> 00:08:23,968
[applause]

198
00:08:23,968 --> 00:08:26,133
You do.

199
00:08:26,133 --> 00:08:27,834
We'll talk more
about that later.

200
00:08:27,834 --> 00:08:30,000
Since you don't want
to watch me type for an hour,

201
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,868
we put canned messages
in there.

202
00:08:31,868 --> 00:08:35,968
We'll try hard to pull them out
before we launch.

203
00:08:35,968 --> 00:08:38,767
I click "Done,"
it asks me for more users.

204
00:08:38,767 --> 00:08:40,567
I'll add Stephanie.

205
00:08:40,567 --> 00:08:42,067
And since she is offline,

206
00:08:42,067 --> 00:08:45,567
I'm going to go stare
at a blank page.

207
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,501
Hannon: So I will
open Wave.

208
00:08:48,501 --> 00:08:50,834
And you'll see in my
Search panel, the middle panel,

209
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:53,634
will be an unread
message from Lars.

210
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:55,534
He's asking me
if I want to go shopping,

211
00:08:55,534 --> 00:08:56,701
uh, before this
boat trip,

212
00:08:56,701 --> 00:08:58,534
so I'll do something
very email like,

213
00:08:58,534 --> 00:08:59,968
which is hit "Reply,"

214
00:08:59,968 --> 00:09:03,734
and say,
"I looove shopping."

215
00:09:03,734 --> 00:09:05,834
Lars Rasmussen:
I wrote the script.

216
00:09:05,834 --> 00:09:11,400
Hannon: "I need new fins.
Let's go."

217
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,434
The first benefit
I want to show you

218
00:09:13,434 --> 00:09:15,467
of this being
a hosted conversation

219
00:09:15,467 --> 00:09:18,467
is it's easier
to keep track of structure.

220
00:09:18,467 --> 00:09:20,300
If this was email
and I wanted to reply

221
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,901
to the middle part
of Lars's message

222
00:09:21,901 --> 00:09:24,000
where he asked
which bus to take,

223
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,434
I would hit "Reply," the email
client would copy the message,

224
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:29,901
and I'd hand-edit
in the response.

225
00:09:29,901 --> 00:09:31,501
Because this is
a hosted conversation

226
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:33,667
that lives in one place,

227
00:09:33,667 --> 00:09:37,067
I can just instruct the server
to split the message apart

228
00:09:37,067 --> 00:09:40,701
and say,
"You never wake up early,"

229
00:09:40,701 --> 00:09:42,734
which is true.

230
00:09:42,734 --> 00:09:45,734
"Let's take the late bus."

231
00:09:45,734 --> 00:09:49,400
Okay, Lars isn't online;
I'm going to close this wave.

232
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,501
Lars Rasmussen: So a little bit
later I come back online,

233
00:09:51,501 --> 00:09:54,100
and you'll see, for starters,
that that wave is now bold

234
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,234
to show me there is
new material in it.

235
00:09:56,234 --> 00:09:59,634
When I open it up, Stephanie's
first message gets the highlight

236
00:09:59,634 --> 00:10:02,234
and I can navigate the
conversation with my keyboard,

237
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:04,133
and of course,
continue her thread here.

238
00:10:04,133 --> 00:10:06,667
"You know me too well."

239
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:08,033
Like that.

240
00:10:08,033 --> 00:10:11,133
And that's how plain vanilla
email-type conversations

241
00:10:11,133 --> 00:10:13,067
work in Wave.

242
00:10:13,067 --> 00:10:15,234
So you've noticed that
we have carefully avoided

243
00:10:15,234 --> 00:10:17,133
having the wave open
on both screens.

244
00:10:17,133 --> 00:10:20,701
When we do have the wave
open at the same time,

245
00:10:20,701 --> 00:10:23,234
my message bounces
right off the server

246
00:10:23,234 --> 00:10:24,934
into Stephanie's browser.

247
00:10:24,934 --> 00:10:26,300
The effect is
that you can also

248
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,033
do Instant Messaging-type
conversations in Wave.

249
00:10:29,033 --> 00:10:32,667
In fact in the same wave
you can switch back and forth

250
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:34,667
between these different
ways of communicating.

251
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,834
I'll show you that now.

252
00:10:36,834 --> 00:10:41,000
Shiny.
You must know a good store.

253
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,767
[cheers and applause]

254
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:48,434
Hannon: There is a new one
over on George Street.

255
00:10:48,434 --> 00:10:52,400
Lars Rasmussen: Cool.
Let's go at 7:00.

256
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,267
Hannon: "Sounds good.
Let's invite Jens too."

257
00:10:56,267 --> 00:10:57,734
Lars Rasmussen: "Okay."

258
00:10:57,734 --> 00:11:00,567
So you noticed that it didn't
wait for me to hit "Done"

259
00:11:00,567 --> 00:11:02,534
before showing
Stephanie the message,

260
00:11:02,534 --> 00:11:04,400
but rather--and this was
difficult to do--

261
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,167
we transmit live almost
character by character

262
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,567
what I'm typing.

263
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:09,801
Why did we do that?

264
00:11:09,801 --> 00:11:11,534
It's because with today
instant messaging tools

265
00:11:11,534 --> 00:11:14,434
you spend half of your time
looking at it saying,

266
00:11:14,434 --> 00:11:16,934
"Stephanie is typing,
she's typing, she's typing,

267
00:11:16,934 --> 00:11:21,133
she's typing,"
and then you see what she said.

268
00:11:21,133 --> 00:11:23,968
Thank you.
[laughs]

269
00:11:23,968 --> 00:11:27,834
But because in general you can
start formulating your own reply

270
00:11:27,834 --> 00:11:30,133
before Stephanie
is done typing hers,

271
00:11:30,133 --> 00:11:31,968
by doing this
live transmission,

272
00:11:31,968 --> 00:11:34,634
you end up spending 100% of your
time either reading or writing,

273
00:11:34,634 --> 00:11:37,133
which dramatically
speeds up the conversation.

274
00:11:37,133 --> 00:11:38,734
Now needless to say,
there are times

275
00:11:38,734 --> 00:11:41,000
you don't want everyone
to see every keystroke,

276
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,300
in particular
if you spell like I do.

277
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,267
Um, and so we have
this checkbox here.

278
00:11:46,267 --> 00:11:47,567
All you have to do
is check it

279
00:11:47,567 --> 00:11:49,334
and now no one can
see what you're typing

280
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,901
until you hit
that "Done" button.

281
00:11:50,901 --> 00:11:53,901
This is one of the features we
haven't implemented quite yet.

282
00:11:53,901 --> 00:11:58,133
[laughter]

283
00:11:58,133 --> 00:12:00,567
Okay, so that's how
email conversations,

284
00:12:00,567 --> 00:12:02,400
or rather email-type
conversations

285
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,801
and instant messaging-type
conversations

286
00:12:04,801 --> 00:12:07,501
no longer require
two separate tools.

287
00:12:07,501 --> 00:12:09,400
Next thing we want
to show you is how easy it is

288
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,834
to add a new person
to an ongoing conversation.

289
00:12:12,834 --> 00:12:15,300
Can I just introduce
my brother Jens, by the way?

290
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,868
Give him a hand, please.

291
00:12:16,868 --> 00:12:19,801
[cheers and applause]

292
00:12:22,834 --> 00:12:23,968
So we want to--

293
00:12:23,968 --> 00:12:25,734
We want to add Jens
to the conversation.

294
00:12:25,734 --> 00:12:28,634
If this was email, I would
take the last message here,

295
00:12:28,634 --> 00:12:31,467
reply to it and add Jens
to the recipient list.

296
00:12:31,467 --> 00:12:32,467
There's two problems
with that.

297
00:12:32,467 --> 00:12:33,701
For starters,

298
00:12:33,701 --> 00:12:36,100
because we branched
the conversation up here,

299
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,467
that last email message

300
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:39,734
would not contain
the entire conversation.

301
00:12:39,734 --> 00:12:42,434
But also,
if Stephanie then later

302
00:12:42,434 --> 00:12:44,767
went and replied to
an earlier message of mine,

303
00:12:44,767 --> 00:12:46,267
Jens wouldn't
get that anyway.

304
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:48,501
You end up with these
cat and mouse games.

305
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:51,234
In the Wave model,
all you have to do

306
00:12:51,234 --> 00:12:55,400
is make Jens a participant
in the wave like that.

307
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,334
And now I'll switch
over to Firefox here

308
00:12:58,334 --> 00:13:01,701
where Jens is
already signed in.

309
00:13:01,701 --> 00:13:03,267
Jens Rasmussen:
So now that I'm on the wave,

310
00:13:03,267 --> 00:13:05,834
um, I'm going to open it,

311
00:13:05,834 --> 00:13:08,100
and, of course, everything
is going to be marked

312
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,300
as unread for me.

313
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,968
But because
I was added late,

314
00:13:11,968 --> 00:13:14,501
I didn't get to see
Lars's message in one piece,

315
00:13:14,501 --> 00:13:17,934
and by the time I'm added they
could be arbitrarily far apart.

316
00:13:17,934 --> 00:13:20,968
So we added a feature
called Playback.

317
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:23,601
So I get to see
Lars's original message,

318
00:13:23,601 --> 00:13:26,467
Lars asks Stephanie,
Stephanie replies,

319
00:13:26,467 --> 00:13:29,868
Steph does in-line reply,
and so on, and so on.

320
00:13:29,868 --> 00:13:32,334
[applause]

321
00:13:32,334 --> 00:13:34,767
Thank you.

322
00:13:34,767 --> 00:13:37,601
So Playback turns out to be
a really useful feature,

323
00:13:37,601 --> 00:13:38,634
particularly when the wave

324
00:13:38,634 --> 00:13:39,968
starts picking up
more structure,

325
00:13:39,968 --> 00:13:41,801
and we'll show you
more of that later.

326
00:13:41,801 --> 00:13:43,801
But now that I've
caught up on this wave,

327
00:13:43,801 --> 00:13:48,067
I'm going to just
add my reply.

328
00:13:48,067 --> 00:13:50,334
"Me too."

329
00:13:50,334 --> 00:13:51,868
Oh, I think I crashed.

330
00:13:51,868 --> 00:13:54,334
Lars Rasmussen: Did I mention
that it's a developer preview?

331
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,601
[laughter]

332
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,667
So we made sure
to inject a few bugs

333
00:13:57,667 --> 00:13:59,234
so that you wouldn't have
too high expecta--

334
00:13:59,234 --> 00:14:00,701
I'm just kidding.

335
00:14:05,267 --> 00:14:07,067
Jens Rasmussen: Did you notice
how quickly it reloads?

336
00:14:07,067 --> 00:14:09,767
[laughter]

337
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:13,367
Did we mention
we used GWT?

338
00:14:13,367 --> 00:14:16,133
All right, so I'm
going to add my reply.

339
00:14:16,133 --> 00:14:17,934
"Me too.

340
00:14:17,934 --> 00:14:22,701
Don't forget your keys."

341
00:14:22,701 --> 00:14:24,400
And then I'll hand it back
to Lars.

342
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,934
Lars Rasmussen: Thank you.

343
00:14:25,934 --> 00:14:28,334
So that's how easy it is
to add a new person

344
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:30,000
to an ongoing
conversation.

345
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,634
And so often
we end up having

346
00:14:31,634 --> 00:14:33,534
very nice
group conversations in Wave.

347
00:14:33,534 --> 00:14:35,367
And then occasionally
you want to say something

348
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:38,133
in a wave that's not visible
to all the participants.

349
00:14:38,133 --> 00:14:40,601
We call that
a "Private Reply,"

350
00:14:40,601 --> 00:14:42,534
and I'll add one
down here at the bottom,

351
00:14:42,534 --> 00:14:43,734
and I'll say,

352
00:14:43,734 --> 00:14:49,267
"Let's buy Steph
a reeeally nice present."

353
00:14:49,267 --> 00:14:51,667
Hannon: I wrote this part.

354
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:53,901
Lars Rasmussen: And then
I will add just Jens,

355
00:14:53,901 --> 00:14:55,200
and you will see,

356
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,400
if I just quickly
flip over to Jens's browser,

357
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,901
and scroll down,

358
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:01,901
he sees that
private reply,

359
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,033
but if you look
at Stephanie's screen,

360
00:15:04,033 --> 00:15:06,067
she doesn't see it.

361
00:15:06,067 --> 00:15:07,501
If you remember,
I've explained

362
00:15:07,501 --> 00:15:09,434
that a wave is
a tree structure of messages.

363
00:15:09,434 --> 00:15:13,100
Essentially you can take
any sub-tree of the wave

364
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:17,467
and restrict access
to a subset of the participants.

365
00:15:17,467 --> 00:15:20,767
Okay, I switch back
to my own account, here.

366
00:15:20,767 --> 00:15:22,000
The next thing
we want to show you

367
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,934
is how attachments
work in Wave.

368
00:15:23,934 --> 00:15:25,100
So we've been
on a boat trip--

369
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,634
It was very nice,
thank you--

370
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,367
And we all
got pictures.

371
00:15:28,367 --> 00:15:30,634
I have six of them
sitting here on my desktop,

372
00:15:30,634 --> 00:15:35,400
and I'm going to drag them
onto the wave like this.

373
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,334
[applause]

374
00:15:42,267 --> 00:15:44,434
Hannon: You might not
have noticed,

375
00:15:44,434 --> 00:15:47,033
but the thumbnails
appeared on my screen

376
00:15:47,033 --> 00:15:50,934
long before the full images were
uploaded from Lars's computer.

377
00:15:50,934 --> 00:15:52,100
I'll show you
that again

378
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,934
by dragging in
my own photos from iPhoto.

379
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,667
Ready?
Here we go.

380
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:02,767
Lars Rasmussen: And you can see
them show up over on my screen.

381
00:16:02,767 --> 00:16:03,868
audience member: Yeah.

382
00:16:03,868 --> 00:16:04,968
[applause]

383
00:16:04,968 --> 00:16:06,434
Lars Rasmussen:
Don't be shy, you guys.

384
00:16:06,434 --> 00:16:09,300
If you like what you see,
don't be shy letting us know.

385
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,200
[cheers and applause]

386
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:15,033
We can--we can handle pretty
much any amount of applause.

387
00:16:15,033 --> 00:16:17,100
[laughter]

388
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,334
Hannon: This feature--

389
00:16:18,334 --> 00:16:20,767
drag and drop from the desktop
to the browser--

390
00:16:20,767 --> 00:16:25,534
is the one part of Wave
that HTML 5 can't support yet.

391
00:16:25,534 --> 00:16:28,400
We're working on a proposal
to add it to the standard.

392
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,601
In the meantime,
you need to download Gears

393
00:16:30,601 --> 00:16:32,534
for this specific
feature to work.

394
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:36,367
It's the only part of Wave
that you need Gears for.

395
00:16:36,367 --> 00:16:38,400
When Lars
dropped in his images,

396
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,601
you might've noticed
at the bottom of the Wave panel

397
00:16:40,601 --> 00:16:41,834
there's an Image menu

398
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,767
with actions you'd
probably do on images,

399
00:16:43,767 --> 00:16:46,067
like upload or download.

400
00:16:46,067 --> 00:16:47,934
What's important
is these actions

401
00:16:47,934 --> 00:16:50,200
apply to all
the images in the wave,

402
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,267
not just the ones
I dropped in,

403
00:16:52,267 --> 00:16:54,801
which makes Wave really
an easy, lightweight way

404
00:16:54,801 --> 00:16:57,033
to create a group
photo album together,

405
00:16:57,033 --> 00:17:00,634
which is surprisingly
hard to do with today's tools.

406
00:17:00,634 --> 00:17:02,567
Lars Rasmussen: And so here's
the photo album.

407
00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:04,067
This is Captain Athena.

408
00:17:04,067 --> 00:17:06,300
Here's the hard life
down under.

409
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,400
And as advertised,
you'll see over here

410
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,534
Stephanie's images
show up in my slideshow

411
00:17:10,534 --> 00:17:11,701
so that I can show you

412
00:17:11,701 --> 00:17:17,400
just how much fun
life down under is.

413
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,868
And that's images.

414
00:17:19,868 --> 00:17:21,968
So that's how easy it is
to share photos in Wave.

415
00:17:21,968 --> 00:17:23,067
This was a group trip.

416
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:24,501
We'll all throw
our photos in here.

417
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,300
We'd probably share it
with the rest of the office

418
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,834
to make them envious.

419
00:17:27,834 --> 00:17:30,200
In this particular case,
it's not clear

420
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,100
that we want everyone to know
that we went shopping together.

421
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,267
And so one of the features
down here

422
00:17:35,267 --> 00:17:37,100
lets me copy
just the images

423
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,868
from this wave
into a fresh wave.

424
00:17:39,868 --> 00:17:42,934
"Boating in January.

425
00:17:42,934 --> 00:17:47,901
Enjoy all,
here and yonder."

426
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,701
And then I'll add
Stephanie to this.

427
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:52,801
I could now share that
with the rest of the office.

428
00:17:52,801 --> 00:17:55,801
Now, this feature here
of extracting images

429
00:17:55,801 --> 00:17:57,467
from a wave and putting them
in a new one

430
00:17:57,467 --> 00:17:59,200
is actually part
of a very important

431
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,400
design principle for us.

432
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,901
Namely that we care
just as much

433
00:18:02,901 --> 00:18:06,567
about the product of the wave
as we do the wave itself.

434
00:18:06,567 --> 00:18:11,300
And we'll show you
more examples of that later.

435
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,868
Yes, we will.

436
00:18:13,868 --> 00:18:16,400
Um, I forgot what's next.

437
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,734
Hannon: How 'bout we show them
the embedding APIs?

438
00:18:19,734 --> 00:18:20,734
Lars Rasmussen:
Excellent idea.

439
00:18:20,734 --> 00:18:21,734
Okay, thank you. So...

440
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:22,934
[laughter]

441
00:18:22,934 --> 00:18:24,400
She's right.

442
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,667
We should've rehearsed this
before coming this morning.

443
00:18:26,667 --> 00:18:27,667
Just kidding.

444
00:18:27,667 --> 00:18:29,267
So the first--

445
00:18:29,267 --> 00:18:32,901
The first category of, um,
APIs that we want to show you

446
00:18:32,901 --> 00:18:37,334
are APIs that let you
embed waves onto your webpage.

447
00:18:37,334 --> 00:18:40,601
It is very similar
to the Maps API,

448
00:18:40,601 --> 00:18:43,767
which, by the way, um,
thank you, everyone who used it.

449
00:18:43,767 --> 00:18:46,501
We consider your enthusiasm
for that API

450
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:49,067
an enormous factor
in that product's success,

451
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:52,567
and we're hoping, obviously,
to repeat that with Wave.

452
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:54,667
Hannon: Give a round
of applause to themselves.

453
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,534
Lars Rasmussen: Oh, yeah,
a round of applause to yourself.

454
00:18:56,534 --> 00:18:58,534
Well done.
[applause]

455
00:18:58,534 --> 00:19:01,133
Lars Rasmussen: Okay, so...
Hannon: Yay, developers!

456
00:19:01,133 --> 00:19:02,734
Lars Rasmussen: Here's
an example application.

457
00:19:02,734 --> 00:19:04,534
It's a little blogging site
we've built.

458
00:19:04,534 --> 00:19:06,167
It's over
on Google App Engine,

459
00:19:06,167 --> 00:19:09,000
but you could build it
anywhere you host your website.

460
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,300
And this blogging site--

461
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,367
In addition to embedding
waves on its pages,

462
00:19:13,367 --> 00:19:16,133
it provides me
with this robotic participant

463
00:19:16,133 --> 00:19:18,834
that we affectionately
call Bloggy.

464
00:19:18,834 --> 00:19:22,934
All I have to do
is add Bloggy to the wave,

465
00:19:22,934 --> 00:19:24,434
and now you'll see--

466
00:19:24,434 --> 00:19:25,601
You can probably
not read that,

467
00:19:25,601 --> 00:19:27,334
but on that yellow banner,

468
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:30,300
all users on the wave
is now warned that Bloggy,

469
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,801
this new participant,
has published the blog

470
00:19:33,801 --> 00:19:36,434
on a page which we built
over an app engine.

471
00:19:36,434 --> 00:19:39,300
Can I just introduce
Gregory Delasander?

472
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,968
He's another PM
on the team.

473
00:19:40,968 --> 00:19:42,868
[cheers and applause]

474
00:19:42,868 --> 00:19:45,534
And he's going to show you
the blog site now.

475
00:19:45,534 --> 00:19:46,601
Delasander: Hi, I'm Greg,

476
00:19:46,601 --> 00:19:47,968
and I'm a huge fan
of Lars's blog,

477
00:19:47,968 --> 00:19:50,667
just like everybody on the team
is told they should be.

478
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:53,534
I'm going to show you...
Hannon: He makes us read it.

479
00:19:53,534 --> 00:19:54,667
Lars Rasmussen:
It's a good blog. Come on.

480
00:19:54,667 --> 00:19:59,501
Delasander: Oh, hold on
just a second.

481
00:19:59,501 --> 00:20:02,033
Did we lose...

482
00:20:02,033 --> 00:20:03,567
Hannon: Did we lose VPN?

483
00:20:03,567 --> 00:20:05,067
Delasander:
Yes, I think we might have.

484
00:20:05,067 --> 00:20:06,734
Hannon: Lars, this is
where you do the dance.

485
00:20:06,734 --> 00:20:07,767
Delasander:
Lars, dance a little bit.

486
00:20:07,767 --> 00:20:08,767
Lars Rasmussen:
Everyone look at me.

487
00:20:08,767 --> 00:20:09,801
Don't look at his screen.

488
00:20:09,801 --> 00:20:11,400
[humming]

489
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,968
The Wave dance.

490
00:20:12,968 --> 00:20:14,801
Delasander: I think
we lost all connectivity.

491
00:20:14,801 --> 00:20:19,234
Lars Rasmussen: Neener, neener.
Neener, neener.

492
00:20:19,234 --> 00:20:22,200
There's not a--
Delasander: And then...

493
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,467
Lars Rasmussen: There's not
a lot of people in the world

494
00:20:23,467 --> 00:20:25,634
that can have their demos
as spectacularly fail

495
00:20:25,634 --> 00:20:29,634
in front of 4,000 people
and not break a sweat.

496
00:20:29,634 --> 00:20:31,300
Hannon: It wasn't the demo,
it was the network.

497
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,067
Lars Rasmussen: We wish
we were one of them.

498
00:20:33,067 --> 00:20:34,501
Delasander: Excellent.

499
00:20:34,501 --> 00:20:36,567
Lars Rasmussen: I think your
proxy server might be missing.

500
00:20:36,567 --> 00:20:38,634
Oh, there we go.
Hannon: All right, we're back.

501
00:20:38,634 --> 00:20:42,200
Delasander:
So as I was saying...

502
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,334
The blog.

503
00:20:44,334 --> 00:20:46,200
So in the blog, one of
the cool things you'll s--

504
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,234
you can see is that we're
not just embedding the images,

505
00:20:49,234 --> 00:20:50,767
we're actually embedding
the whole wave

506
00:20:50,767 --> 00:20:52,334
with all of its UI.

507
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,767
This means
that I can respond.

508
00:20:54,767 --> 00:20:57,601
"Hey, that looks fun.
Why wasn't I invited?"

509
00:20:57,601 --> 00:21:00,601
[cheers and applause]

510
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:06,267
The same way we embed--

511
00:21:06,267 --> 00:21:07,634
And we--we do--

512
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:10,067
You can respond in the same way
you do in the Wave client.

513
00:21:10,067 --> 00:21:11,167
Lars Rasmussen: Exactly.

514
00:21:11,167 --> 00:21:13,667
And so now,
I can see, obviously, uh,

515
00:21:13,667 --> 00:21:15,801
Greg's question
from inside my Wave client.

516
00:21:15,801 --> 00:21:17,300
I can answer from in here.

517
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,400
I don't have to go
to the blog site to do that.

518
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,601
I could if I wanted to,
but I can stay here.

519
00:21:22,601 --> 00:21:28,601
"Um, I lost the phone
with your number."

520
00:21:28,601 --> 00:21:30,667
I really,
truly can't spell.

521
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:32,367
Here we go.

522
00:21:32,367 --> 00:21:34,067
Delasander: So one of
the things you just saw

523
00:21:34,067 --> 00:21:36,501
is that I happened to be online
when Lars was online,

524
00:21:36,501 --> 00:21:39,000
and I saw his response
coming in live on his blog.

525
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,834
That's not always
going to be the case.

526
00:21:40,834 --> 00:21:42,667
Since I responded
to this blog,

527
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:45,901
it'll show up
in my Wave client.

528
00:21:45,901 --> 00:21:49,067
Right after I refresh
my Wave client.

529
00:21:49,067 --> 00:21:51,501
Um, it will show up
in my Wave client

530
00:21:51,501 --> 00:21:54,667
and I can continue
the conversation in there.

531
00:21:54,667 --> 00:21:57,367
"But, Lars,
I live next door."

532
00:21:57,367 --> 00:22:00,067
[laughter]

533
00:22:00,067 --> 00:22:01,868
And, um--
And then we can--

534
00:22:01,868 --> 00:22:04,868
That response shows up
on the blog,

535
00:22:04,868 --> 00:22:06,534
we can continue
the conversation from there,

536
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:09,501
and anyone else can
join in that conversation.

537
00:22:09,501 --> 00:22:11,200
Lars Rasmussen: Thank you, Greg.
Delasander: No problem.

538
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,701
[applause]

539
00:22:14,701 --> 00:22:17,200
Lars Rasmussen:
Thank you.

540
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,601
And so this, again,
is an example

541
00:22:19,601 --> 00:22:23,434
of how to use our embedding APIs
to put blogs on your web pages,

542
00:22:23,434 --> 00:22:25,267
and here we showed you
with a blogging site,

543
00:22:25,267 --> 00:22:27,067
but you could imagine
discussion group sites,

544
00:22:27,067 --> 00:22:28,267
community forums--

545
00:22:28,267 --> 00:22:29,534
if you have
a rich-media site

546
00:22:29,534 --> 00:22:33,200
you can let your users
discuss that using waves.

547
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,901
The benefit
for developers, of course,

548
00:22:34,901 --> 00:22:38,067
is you get to provide
this very live, rich experience

549
00:22:38,067 --> 00:22:39,534
with very little code.

550
00:22:39,534 --> 00:22:43,567
For your users, for starters,
they get to use a familiar UI,

551
00:22:43,567 --> 00:22:46,234
but for those of your users
that have Wave accounts,

552
00:22:46,234 --> 00:22:48,067
they get to walk
around the Web

553
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:50,968
and aggregate the conversations
they're interested in

554
00:22:50,968 --> 00:22:52,734
into the Wave client
so that they don't

555
00:22:52,734 --> 00:22:55,300
have to go check back
on 10,000 different pages

556
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,167
whether someone
responded to them.

557
00:22:57,167 --> 00:23:00,067
Which will make flame wars
so much more effective.

558
00:23:00,067 --> 00:23:01,801
[laughter]

559
00:23:01,801 --> 00:23:03,200
She hates that joke.

560
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,634
Hannon: I hate it.
[laughs]

561
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:06,801
Lars Rasmussen: Okay.

562
00:23:06,801 --> 00:23:09,067
So that was an example
of how to embed waves.

563
00:23:09,067 --> 00:23:11,200
The embedding APIs
can do other things,

564
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,767
and Stephanie
will show you that now.

565
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,667
Hannon: So we invited
some of our colleagues

566
00:23:15,667 --> 00:23:17,667
from Brazil and India
to Sydney

567
00:23:17,667 --> 00:23:20,667
who work on one of our
social networks called Orkut.

568
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:23,334
We wanted to build a demo
of what it could look like

569
00:23:23,334 --> 00:23:25,133
to put waves
inside of Orkut.

570
00:23:25,133 --> 00:23:28,200
Obviously, it's a place where
lots of discussions happen.

571
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,067
It demonstrates
three important principles,

572
00:23:31,067 --> 00:23:34,901
or features,
of our embed API.

573
00:23:34,901 --> 00:23:37,000
Let me load up the demo.

574
00:23:42,501 --> 00:23:44,400
So here's my Orkut account.

575
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,767
And you can see there's
a Wave panel in the middle.

576
00:23:47,767 --> 00:23:51,200
And the first thing is
I can create a wave on Orkut.

577
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,901
So I'm starting a new wave,
and I'll say, "Brazil trip?

578
00:23:54,901 --> 00:23:59,234
Wonder when Lars
will let me go."

579
00:24:01,467 --> 00:24:03,934
The second important feature
is that you can

580
00:24:03,934 --> 00:24:06,834
use contacts
other than your Wave contacts.

581
00:24:06,834 --> 00:24:08,634
In this case,
the authors of the site

582
00:24:08,634 --> 00:24:10,567
chose to use
the Orkut contacts,

583
00:24:10,567 --> 00:24:12,601
so I can add
some of my Orkut friends

584
00:24:12,601 --> 00:24:16,300
like Sid, Torston,
and Rodrigo,

585
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,734
who all helped
build this demo.

586
00:24:18,734 --> 00:24:21,868
The third principle is that
I can embed a "Search" panel

587
00:24:21,868 --> 00:24:25,934
inside of Orkut
using the embed API.

588
00:24:25,934 --> 00:24:27,200
I'll show you that now.

589
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,601
I can search for all my waves
from here.

590
00:24:32,601 --> 00:24:35,601
And so on.
And look at them.

591
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:38,767
So that's waves
embedded in Orkut.

592
00:24:38,767 --> 00:24:41,267
What's important
is that our embed API

593
00:24:41,267 --> 00:24:45,100
is powerful enough for you
to build your own Wave client.

594
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,901
In this case, the Orkut team

595
00:24:46,901 --> 00:24:49,934
chose to focus on waves
created inside of Orkut.

596
00:24:49,934 --> 00:24:52,167
But just like
in the blog example,

597
00:24:52,167 --> 00:24:54,801
I can go back to my Wave client,

598
00:24:54,801 --> 00:24:57,334
and I can see the wave
I started there.

599
00:24:57,334 --> 00:24:59,968
"Wonder when Lars
will let me go to Brazil."

600
00:24:59,968 --> 00:25:02,868
So that's the embed API.

601
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:04,667
Lars Rasmussen: You guys--
[applause]

602
00:25:04,667 --> 00:25:06,167
Thank you.

603
00:25:09,167 --> 00:25:11,767
Are you guys
feeling inspired yet?

604
00:25:11,767 --> 00:25:13,801
So remember that we're all
going to give you accounts

605
00:25:13,801 --> 00:25:15,334
on a sandbox build,

606
00:25:15,334 --> 00:25:18,901
which is in fact the build that
we're demo-ing from later today,

607
00:25:18,901 --> 00:25:21,033
and this is all
sample applications

608
00:25:21,033 --> 00:25:22,367
that we're hoping
you'll pick up

609
00:25:22,367 --> 00:25:25,501
and build much,
much cooler things with.

610
00:25:25,501 --> 00:25:27,968
Okay, so the next thing
I want to show is

611
00:25:27,968 --> 00:25:31,634
of course you're going to want
Wave on your mobile devices,

612
00:25:31,634 --> 00:25:34,701
and I have an Android
and an iPhone here,

613
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:38,501
and I was going to show you
how well it works communicating

614
00:25:38,501 --> 00:25:41,334
from mobile devices
to the desktop,

615
00:25:41,334 --> 00:25:43,200
but you guys are all
on Facebook, aren't you?

616
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,067
Because I can't
get on the wireless.

617
00:25:46,067 --> 00:25:47,534
[laughter]

618
00:25:47,534 --> 00:25:51,133
So if it doesn't work,
it's your fault.

619
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:53,133
Okay, so you can see
my inbox over here.

620
00:25:53,133 --> 00:25:54,634
This is on
the Android device.

621
00:25:54,634 --> 00:25:56,300
Here's an open--

622
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,133
uh, the same open wave
we saw before.

623
00:25:58,133 --> 00:26:00,067
You see the pretty
pictures here.

624
00:26:00,067 --> 00:26:05,868
And then I can click
the "Reply" button like this,

625
00:26:05,868 --> 00:26:08,734
and you'll see
over on Stephanie's screen,

626
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:11,400
which I can't see.

627
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,200
You will see a reply.

628
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,667
Imagine I was actually
on a network,

629
00:26:15,667 --> 00:26:21,667
and then I could type in,
"I am on the boat."

630
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:23,234
Done.

631
00:26:23,234 --> 00:26:25,534
Notice again my spelling.

632
00:26:25,534 --> 00:26:27,400
And nothing is going
to show up over there

633
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,968
because we haven't
yet figured out

634
00:26:28,968 --> 00:26:32,033
squeezing this through
without a connection.

635
00:26:32,033 --> 00:26:33,467
Maybe we'll show you that.

636
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:35,601
[laughter]

637
00:26:35,601 --> 00:26:37,133
Hannon: As long as it's your
fault that it's not working.

638
00:26:37,133 --> 00:26:38,400
Lars Rasmussen: We are--

639
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,467
Hannon: I just don't
want to screw up the--

640
00:26:39,467 --> 00:26:40,767
Lars Rasmussen:
We are working on it.

641
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:44,133
Okay, so that's mobile.

642
00:26:44,133 --> 00:26:46,000
Hannon: How 'bout
we talk about editing?

643
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,601
Lars Rasmussen:
Oh, that's a brilliant idea.

644
00:26:47,601 --> 00:26:49,067
Thank you.

645
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:51,601
Okay, so the next thing
we're going to show.

646
00:26:51,601 --> 00:26:53,701
Again because, um,
there's only--

647
00:26:53,701 --> 00:26:54,901
Back to my desktop.
Thank you.

648
00:26:54,901 --> 00:26:57,033
There is only one copy
of the wave out there.

649
00:26:57,033 --> 00:26:59,367
Even though we put
these pictures on my blog,

650
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:01,367
I discussed them
with Greg,

651
00:27:01,367 --> 00:27:03,767
uh, we had them
on my mobile device.

652
00:27:03,767 --> 00:27:05,667
Now I notice
that some of the captions

653
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:06,968
are kind of wonky.

654
00:27:06,968 --> 00:27:09,167
And all I have to do is click
this "Edit" button here,

655
00:27:09,167 --> 00:27:11,234
and then I can
fix that.

656
00:27:11,234 --> 00:27:14,767
Kayaks. Beer Man.

657
00:27:14,767 --> 00:27:18,000
Thank you.
[applause]

658
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,267
Hannon: And as you notice,

659
00:27:19,267 --> 00:27:22,734
the captions
are updating on the blog.

660
00:27:22,734 --> 00:27:24,868
Lars Rasmussen: Yes, hopefully
you saw that the captions

661
00:27:24,868 --> 00:27:28,367
were actually updating live
on the blog as I was typing.

662
00:27:28,367 --> 00:27:30,834
So, here I edited
my own message,

663
00:27:30,834 --> 00:27:34,734
but we actually let users edit
each other's messages as well,

664
00:27:34,734 --> 00:27:36,567
which is a very nice effect
that in addition

665
00:27:36,567 --> 00:27:38,300
to everything
we showed you already,

666
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,501
you can use waves

667
00:27:39,501 --> 00:27:41,367
to collaboratively
author documents,

668
00:27:41,367 --> 00:27:42,801
which we'll show you now.

669
00:27:42,801 --> 00:27:45,868
So let's leave the boat behind,
and let's go to work.

670
00:27:45,868 --> 00:27:47,200
Stephanie.

671
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,033
Hannon: As Lars mentioned,
I'm a product manager,

672
00:27:49,033 --> 00:27:51,767
and I often have to
take notes in a meeting.

673
00:27:51,767 --> 00:27:54,200
Today I have to decide
if I want to send those notes

674
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,133
out on email because
I want people to discuss them,

675
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:59,133
or if I'm going to put them
in a dock or a Wiki,

676
00:27:59,133 --> 00:28:01,501
'cause I want other people
to help me edit them.

677
00:28:01,501 --> 00:28:03,968
With Wave you don't
have to make that choice.

678
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:07,234
You can do both discussion
and content collaboration

679
00:28:07,234 --> 00:28:09,133
in one tool.

680
00:28:09,133 --> 00:28:11,067
So these are
our meeting notes.

681
00:28:11,067 --> 00:28:13,501
I'm going to add Lars,

682
00:28:13,501 --> 00:28:17,234
Jens, Greg, and ACD.

683
00:28:17,234 --> 00:28:18,968
[Lars Rasmussen and Hannon
speak over each other]

684
00:28:18,968 --> 00:28:20,167
Lars Rasmussen:
Pardon me.

685
00:28:20,167 --> 00:28:21,234
Hannon: Then you open it.

686
00:28:21,234 --> 00:28:22,434
Lars Rasmussen:
Then I open it.

687
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:24,467
And even though
this is Stephanie's message,

688
00:28:24,467 --> 00:28:26,467
I can click
that same "Edit" button

689
00:28:26,467 --> 00:28:31,634
and change this
to "glorious."

690
00:28:31,634 --> 00:28:33,767
And then I can
add an action item.

691
00:28:33,767 --> 00:28:38,434
"AI. Make more better
AIs, already."

692
00:28:38,434 --> 00:28:39,701
Whoo, like that.

693
00:28:39,701 --> 00:28:40,701
Thank you.

694
00:28:40,701 --> 00:28:43,067
[applause]

695
00:28:43,067 --> 00:28:44,167
Thank you.

696
00:28:44,167 --> 00:28:46,033
And so that's
how easy it is

697
00:28:46,033 --> 00:28:48,033
for me to edit
Stephanie's message.

698
00:28:48,033 --> 00:28:49,334
We want to show you now
how it looks

699
00:28:49,334 --> 00:28:51,200
to the other participants
on the wave--

700
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,968
the fact that
I edited her message.

701
00:28:52,968 --> 00:28:54,467
We'll start
with Stephanie.

702
00:28:54,467 --> 00:28:56,634
Hannon: So you can see
the wave pop back into my inbox

703
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:58,100
because there's
new material.

704
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,868
If I open it,
I see the markups.

705
00:29:01,868 --> 00:29:03,868
So I see the changes
that Lars made.

706
00:29:03,868 --> 00:29:05,567
Lars Rasmussen:
Thank you.

707
00:29:05,567 --> 00:29:09,634
[applause]

708
00:29:09,634 --> 00:29:11,267
Hannon: We haven't
implemented it yet,

709
00:29:11,267 --> 00:29:12,968
but we'll also have
a little description at the top

710
00:29:12,968 --> 00:29:15,367
that says
Lars edited this message.

711
00:29:15,367 --> 00:29:17,968
What's important
is I see these markups

712
00:29:17,968 --> 00:29:20,734
not because I wrote
the original message,

713
00:29:20,734 --> 00:29:23,534
but because I saw
the original message.

714
00:29:23,534 --> 00:29:25,667
Anyone who saw
my original message

715
00:29:25,667 --> 00:29:27,234
would see
these same markups

716
00:29:27,234 --> 00:29:29,300
the next time
they visited the wave

717
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,334
after Lars
made his edits.

718
00:29:31,334 --> 00:29:32,567
Jens Rasmussen:
All right, now,

719
00:29:32,567 --> 00:29:33,868
I didn't get to see
the original message,

720
00:29:33,868 --> 00:29:35,734
so when I open up
this wave,

721
00:29:35,734 --> 00:29:37,467
I just see
the current version of it.

722
00:29:37,467 --> 00:29:38,801
But I do get to see

723
00:29:38,801 --> 00:29:41,934
that both Stephanie and Lars
wrote this message.

724
00:29:41,934 --> 00:29:44,067
Most of the time
I'm not going to care,

725
00:29:44,067 --> 00:29:47,734
but if I do care, then Playback
is my friend again.

726
00:29:47,734 --> 00:29:49,834
So I see Stephanie's
original message,

727
00:29:49,834 --> 00:29:51,200
she adds Lars,

728
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,334
and then I get to see
Lars's edits.

729
00:29:55,334 --> 00:29:58,167
[applause]

730
00:29:58,167 --> 00:30:00,334
Thank you.

731
00:30:00,334 --> 00:30:01,868
So now that we have
accountability--

732
00:30:01,868 --> 00:30:03,501
accountability in place,

733
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:05,834
we're going to allow
everybody on a wave

734
00:30:05,834 --> 00:30:08,000
to edit everything
by default.

735
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,234
When something
is changed,

736
00:30:09,234 --> 00:30:10,968
the author
is notified immediately,

737
00:30:10,968 --> 00:30:12,934
and, if needed,
can take action.

738
00:30:12,934 --> 00:30:17,234
and everybody who's on the wave
can find out who did what.

739
00:30:17,234 --> 00:30:20,367
So Stephanie promised
that we were going to do

740
00:30:20,367 --> 00:30:22,968
collaboration and communication
using the same tool.

741
00:30:22,968 --> 00:30:24,501
Hannon: I did.
Jens Rasmussen: So I'm going--

742
00:30:24,501 --> 00:30:27,300
Now that I know that Lars made
this--the request for more AIs,

743
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:30,701
I'm going to use the in-line
reply tool we showed earlier,

744
00:30:30,701 --> 00:30:34,868
um, to add my reply here.

745
00:30:34,868 --> 00:30:40,767
"No, enough AIs already."

746
00:30:40,767 --> 00:30:44,100
My spelling is not
doing well either.

747
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,100
Lars Rasmussen: It's hard
when 4,000 people are watching.

748
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,334
Jens Rasmussen:
Typing and talking?

749
00:30:47,334 --> 00:30:48,801
It's a little bit
too much.

750
00:30:48,801 --> 00:30:50,567
There we go.
So I'll hand it back to Lars.

751
00:30:50,567 --> 00:30:51,567
Lars Rasmussen:
Okay, thank you.

752
00:30:51,567 --> 00:30:53,033
So notice--

753
00:30:53,033 --> 00:30:56,000
Notice that we never said,
"Let's start a document, here."

754
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,534
These are all
just waves.

755
00:30:57,534 --> 00:30:58,767
The only thing
different here

756
00:30:58,767 --> 00:31:01,167
is that we chose to think
of that opening message

757
00:31:01,167 --> 00:31:03,901
more like a document
we're collaborating about

758
00:31:03,901 --> 00:31:06,667
than a message
that starts a conversation.

759
00:31:06,667 --> 00:31:09,634
And then we're choosing to think
about that in-line reply

760
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:11,567
more like the beginning
of a conversation

761
00:31:11,567 --> 00:31:13,601
about the point
in that document.

762
00:31:13,601 --> 00:31:15,767
But to the system,
they're all just waves,

763
00:31:15,767 --> 00:31:17,934
and in fact,
you can collaboratively edit

764
00:31:17,934 --> 00:31:19,634
any message
in the tree.

765
00:31:19,634 --> 00:31:22,501
Doesn't have to be, uh,
document-like at all.

766
00:31:22,501 --> 00:31:24,634
Stephanie often comes
and very friendly fixes

767
00:31:24,634 --> 00:31:27,200
all of my spelling errors.

768
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,801
And so we think this combination
of collaborative editing

769
00:31:31,801 --> 00:31:33,033
and in-line discussion

770
00:31:33,033 --> 00:31:35,767
makes for a very powerful
collaboration tool.

771
00:31:35,767 --> 00:31:38,767
And I want to show you that
with a design document

772
00:31:38,767 --> 00:31:41,100
that the team wrote
a while back.

773
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,901
Let me just reconfigure
my client, here.

774
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:49,467
I'm going to go do a safe
search, find the document here,

775
00:31:49,467 --> 00:31:51,434
Let me make some more
space for it.

776
00:31:51,434 --> 00:31:54,501
And you'll see here
that it's a RISTEX document.

777
00:31:54,501 --> 00:31:55,968
It's got headlines,
it's got bullet points.

778
00:31:55,968 --> 00:31:58,567
It's got illustrations,
different types of fonts.

779
00:31:58,567 --> 00:31:59,934
And then it's interrupted

780
00:31:59,934 --> 00:32:02,300
by these little snippets
of conversation

781
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:05,234
that help facilitate
the collaboration.

782
00:32:05,234 --> 00:32:07,534
And as always, the best way
to see how this happened

783
00:32:07,534 --> 00:32:09,167
is to play back the wave.

784
00:32:09,167 --> 00:32:11,100
And you'll see Steven,
our trusted server guy,

785
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,634
started out
with a terse draft.

786
00:32:13,634 --> 00:32:15,734
He added the rest of the team

787
00:32:15,734 --> 00:32:18,434
Lars the manager
says, "Please do more work."

788
00:32:18,434 --> 00:32:20,601
Steven grudgingly
adds another paragraph.

789
00:32:20,601 --> 00:32:22,434
He says, "Yeah, whatever."

790
00:32:22,434 --> 00:32:24,934
Then Stephanie the PM
makes an edit here.

791
00:32:24,934 --> 00:32:26,534
She adds a comment there,

792
00:32:26,534 --> 00:32:29,167
starts a discussion there,
and so on.

793
00:32:29,167 --> 00:32:31,501
I can use the slider
here to drag it

794
00:32:31,501 --> 00:32:34,300
to anywhere in the history
of the wave.

795
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,801
And we're planning
a bunch of power tools

796
00:32:36,801 --> 00:32:38,000
that come with Playback.

797
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,601
For example,
I might ask it

798
00:32:39,601 --> 00:32:41,868
only to play back
Stephanie's contribution.

799
00:32:41,868 --> 00:32:44,167
So I might ask it to only
play back a single message

800
00:32:44,167 --> 00:32:47,100
or even a single paragraph
inside a message.

801
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,667
we're definitely going to
let you take

802
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:50,467
one change in the history

803
00:32:50,467 --> 00:32:52,801
and revert it at the end
of the history.

804
00:32:52,801 --> 00:32:55,701
Maybe name aversion so that you
can find it again and so on.

805
00:32:55,701 --> 00:32:57,934
Playback is going to be
a really powerful tool

806
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:00,334
for investigating
and manipulating

807
00:33:00,334 --> 00:33:04,000
the entire history
of the wave.

808
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Thank you.

809
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,067
[applause]

810
00:33:10,701 --> 00:33:13,534
And so now imagine we're done
with the design document.

811
00:33:13,534 --> 00:33:15,567
Or we find we're
in a good state;

812
00:33:15,567 --> 00:33:17,234
we want to share it
with a wider audience.

813
00:33:17,234 --> 00:33:19,834
You'll notice it's not super
comfortable reading a document

814
00:33:19,834 --> 00:33:21,534
interrupted by all
this discussion,

815
00:33:21,534 --> 00:33:23,567
so we added
this widget here

816
00:33:23,567 --> 00:33:27,434
that lets you hide
and show some discussions,

817
00:33:27,434 --> 00:33:31,567
but also, just like we extracted
images from a wave earlier,

818
00:33:31,567 --> 00:33:33,434
we let you extract
the current version

819
00:33:33,434 --> 00:33:36,667
of any message in a tree
into a fresh wave.

820
00:33:36,667 --> 00:33:37,934
Like this.

821
00:33:37,934 --> 00:33:39,501
And now I have a fresh wave

822
00:33:39,501 --> 00:33:42,334
with the pristine
product of our work,

823
00:33:42,334 --> 00:33:44,200
which I can now submit
to the server

824
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,767
and share with
whomever I like,

825
00:33:45,767 --> 00:33:49,367
put on a mailing list internal
blog or even keep working on.

826
00:33:49,367 --> 00:33:52,067
And in fact, we're planning
more features here

827
00:33:52,067 --> 00:33:53,667
for document production.

828
00:33:53,667 --> 00:33:55,567
Imagine you go back
and do more work

829
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:57,067
in the original wave.

830
00:33:57,067 --> 00:33:59,567
Then you'll be able
to merge just those changes

831
00:33:59,567 --> 00:34:01,734
into that same
product wave.

832
00:34:01,734 --> 00:34:04,567
The product wave will just
have a two-step history now,

833
00:34:04,567 --> 00:34:07,367
where each step is attributed
to whoever did the copy.

834
00:34:07,367 --> 00:34:10,567
In fact, and you guys will
recognize this as, um,

835
00:34:10,567 --> 00:34:12,234
inspired by
source-controlled systems.

836
00:34:12,234 --> 00:34:13,634
We'll have you--

837
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,434
We'll let you have
a whole string of work waves,

838
00:34:15,434 --> 00:34:17,501
all pointing
to the same product wave.

839
00:34:17,501 --> 00:34:18,801
You can have
different themes

840
00:34:18,801 --> 00:34:20,801
working on different
parts of a wave,

841
00:34:20,801 --> 00:34:22,300
and then when
one team merges

842
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,300
and that changes
into the product wave,

843
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,868
the other teams
can pull that down,

844
00:34:25,868 --> 00:34:28,000
merge it with
the local changes, and so on.

845
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,400
So this is
going to become

846
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:33,634
a very powerful
document production tool.

847
00:34:33,634 --> 00:34:34,634
Thank you.

848
00:34:34,634 --> 00:34:37,567
[applause]

849
00:34:39,901 --> 00:34:42,667
We showed you this,
of course, with, um,

850
00:34:42,667 --> 00:34:44,801
with, uh,
rich text documents.

851
00:34:44,801 --> 00:34:46,067
There's no reason
we shouldn't

852
00:34:46,067 --> 00:34:48,567
later add spreadsheet-type
functionality in there,

853
00:34:48,567 --> 00:34:50,901
or presentation building-type
functionality in there.

854
00:34:50,901 --> 00:34:53,701
In fact as we'll show you later,
we've taken great care

855
00:34:53,701 --> 00:34:56,868
to make the content model
inside Wave extendable,

856
00:34:56,868 --> 00:34:59,634
both by us and by you.

857
00:34:59,634 --> 00:35:00,968
Okay, the next thing I want--

858
00:35:00,968 --> 00:35:02,367
Hannon: Why don't you
just talk for a minute

859
00:35:02,367 --> 00:35:03,634
before you open it?

860
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:05,000
Lars Rasmussen:
Talk for a minute...

861
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,133
Hannon: You know.

862
00:35:06,133 --> 00:35:07,334
Lars Rasmussen:
Before I open it.

863
00:35:07,334 --> 00:35:08,734
Hannon: 30 seconds.

864
00:35:08,734 --> 00:35:10,567
Lars Rasmussen: We could do
a little interpretive dance

865
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:11,801
while we open it.

866
00:35:11,801 --> 00:35:12,868
It's not that there's
anything wrong

867
00:35:12,868 --> 00:35:13,901
with the thing
I was about to open,

868
00:35:13,901 --> 00:35:14,901
it's just that--

869
00:35:14,901 --> 00:35:15,901
How're you guys doing?

870
00:35:15,901 --> 00:35:17,467
[laughter]

871
00:35:17,467 --> 00:35:18,968
Are you having
a good time?

872
00:35:18,968 --> 00:35:20,434
I know it's a long demo.
Thank you.

873
00:35:20,434 --> 00:35:23,067
Don't be shy
if you like it.

874
00:35:23,067 --> 00:35:24,300
Hannon:
All right, we're ready.

875
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,501
Lars Rasmussen:
There's a whole bunch of people

876
00:35:25,501 --> 00:35:28,200
in blue shirts working
feverishly over there.

877
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,801
[chuckles]
And we're ready.

878
00:35:30,801 --> 00:35:33,634
Okay, so here is
a wave, um...

879
00:35:33,634 --> 00:35:34,901
Here is a wave.
That's right.

880
00:35:34,901 --> 00:35:37,267
So my little introduction
here is the following:

881
00:35:37,267 --> 00:35:38,267
We're going
to show you now

882
00:35:38,267 --> 00:35:40,667
the thing we had
the most fun working on.

883
00:35:40,667 --> 00:35:43,234
As in this was
the hardest thing we did.

884
00:35:43,234 --> 00:35:46,334
Um, which is to let
more than one person

885
00:35:46,334 --> 00:35:48,334
edit the same message
at the same time

886
00:35:48,334 --> 00:35:51,167
and still transmitting
the characters live on the wire.

887
00:35:51,167 --> 00:35:52,934
So we have
a set of pictures here,

888
00:35:52,934 --> 00:35:54,501
and Stephanie
is going to start

889
00:35:54,501 --> 00:35:56,267
at the top-left
editing the captions.

890
00:35:56,267 --> 00:35:57,601
You can see on my screen

891
00:35:57,601 --> 00:36:00,400
I can see exactly where
that orange label--where she is,

892
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,968
and I'm going to start
from the lower-right.

893
00:36:02,968 --> 00:36:04,367
Hannon: "Thumbs up."

894
00:36:04,367 --> 00:36:06,000
Lars Rasmussen: "Spelling
Google."

895
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,767
Hannon: "Lars in the lead."

896
00:36:07,767 --> 00:36:09,133
Lars Rasmussen: "Smiley David."

897
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:11,000
Hannon: "Wave crew hiking."
Lars Rasmussen: "Kapow."

898
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,667
[applause]

899
00:36:12,667 --> 00:36:14,067
Thank you.

900
00:36:14,067 --> 00:36:15,701
Now we're very close
to each other.

901
00:36:15,701 --> 00:36:17,701
I'll add some
styling here.

902
00:36:17,701 --> 00:36:19,267
I'll make this italic.

903
00:36:19,267 --> 00:36:22,000
Oh, boy, if someone
can add some color.

904
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,167
We can do this.

905
00:36:23,167 --> 00:36:25,367
Notice how close
we can edit to each other.

906
00:36:25,367 --> 00:36:26,968
You can see we've got
a couple of--

907
00:36:26,968 --> 00:36:28,300
of our team
has joined us.

908
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,501
We've got three people here.

909
00:36:29,501 --> 00:36:32,934
Casey, Steph, Ophir and Dan.

910
00:36:32,934 --> 00:36:34,300
We have four people now,

911
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:37,067
editing the same document
right next to each other.

912
00:36:37,067 --> 00:36:40,000
[applause]

913
00:36:41,067 --> 00:36:42,000
Thank you.

914
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:45,801
Thank you.

915
00:36:45,801 --> 00:36:47,934
And so apart
from hours and hours of fun

916
00:36:47,934 --> 00:36:50,434
just chasing each other's
carrots around on the screen...

917
00:36:50,434 --> 00:36:51,968
[laughter]

918
00:36:51,968 --> 00:36:54,234
Hannon: It's a lot of fun.
Lars Rasmussen: A lot of fun.

919
00:36:54,234 --> 00:36:57,934
Um, the--the--this sort
of live, concurrent editing

920
00:36:57,934 --> 00:37:00,300
opens up a whole set
of new ways of using the tool.

921
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,033
We're actually
still discovering some.

922
00:37:02,033 --> 00:37:03,868
Imagine you're
in the same room,

923
00:37:03,868 --> 00:37:05,467
you're taking notes
from a meeting.

924
00:37:05,467 --> 00:37:07,501
Oftentimes people don't even
come to the meeting,

925
00:37:07,501 --> 00:37:10,534
they just open up the wave,
see the notes being taken,

926
00:37:10,534 --> 00:37:14,100
they just pop their questions
in the wave, and so on.

927
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,434
I want to--
while I'm showing off our edit,

928
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:18,167
I want to
make sure you see

929
00:37:18,167 --> 00:37:20,667
that it supports
right-to-left languages.

930
00:37:20,667 --> 00:37:23,300
This is Ophir
speaking in Hebrew.

931
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,300
Thank you.

932
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:28,000
[applause]

933
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,534
You see up at the top-left that
the editor supports languages

934
00:37:31,534 --> 00:37:35,801
that require international
input method editors as well.

935
00:37:35,801 --> 00:37:40,033
I'm pretty sure
that's Chinese.

936
00:37:40,033 --> 00:37:42,434
Okay.
That's collaborative editing.

937
00:37:46,667 --> 00:37:48,200
And now...

938
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,434
Man, this is a long demo.

939
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:51,934
You guys want
to stand up a little?

940
00:37:51,934 --> 00:37:52,934
Stretch.
Hannon: Any stretching?

941
00:37:52,934 --> 00:37:53,934
Lars Rasmussen:
Stretch a little.

942
00:37:53,934 --> 00:37:55,634
Hug the person
next to you.

943
00:37:55,634 --> 00:37:56,634
[laughter]

944
00:37:56,634 --> 00:37:57,734
You don't
have to do that.

945
00:37:57,734 --> 00:38:00,801
Hannon: A hug break.
Make some friends.

946
00:38:00,801 --> 00:38:02,868
Lars Rasmussen: Um, I want
to take a little break.

947
00:38:02,868 --> 00:38:04,300
We have lots more
to show you,

948
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,767
but I want to take
a little break,

949
00:38:05,767 --> 00:38:09,634
and I want to, um, call out
to our friends and colleagues

950
00:38:09,634 --> 00:38:11,868
on the Google Web Toolkit team.

951
00:38:11,868 --> 00:38:12,868
So--Thank you.

952
00:38:12,868 --> 00:38:14,334
[applause]

953
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:18,434
Thank you.

954
00:38:18,434 --> 00:38:22,667
So Google Wave is 100% built
with the Google Web Toolkit

955
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:25,167
from the first line of code
we wrote in a prototype

956
00:38:25,167 --> 00:38:27,667
back in early 2007.

957
00:38:27,667 --> 00:38:30,100
And as I'm sure you know,
the Google Web Toolkit

958
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:34,267
lets you write HTML 5
applications in Java.

959
00:38:34,267 --> 00:38:36,367
And then GWT,
as we call it,

960
00:38:36,367 --> 00:38:40,133
automatically translates that
into HTML, JavaScript, CSS,

961
00:38:40,133 --> 00:38:41,968
all of those things
that then run

962
00:38:41,968 --> 00:38:43,968
in all
of the modern browsers.

963
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:47,467
And I think that we couldn't
possibly have built

964
00:38:47,467 --> 00:38:50,033
something this rich
without the Google Web Toolkit.

965
00:38:50,033 --> 00:38:54,133
In fact, I don't think we would
even have thought to do that.

966
00:38:54,133 --> 00:38:56,968
I think using
modern tools like this

967
00:38:56,968 --> 00:38:58,534
changes your way
of thinking.

968
00:38:58,534 --> 00:39:01,868
When I was still hand rolling
JavaScript for Google Maps,

969
00:39:01,868 --> 00:39:05,067
I found too much
of my brain cycles

970
00:39:05,067 --> 00:39:07,634
were used worrying about
the constraints of programming

971
00:39:07,634 --> 00:39:09,934
in a scripting language
in a browser.

972
00:39:09,934 --> 00:39:12,000
But by using GWT,
I get to write in Java

973
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,734
and have this
amazing set of tools

974
00:39:13,734 --> 00:39:15,501
that come with
writing in Java,

975
00:39:15,501 --> 00:39:17,067
and we found
that our programmers

976
00:39:17,067 --> 00:39:18,834
can now spend
most of their time

977
00:39:18,834 --> 00:39:23,033
thinking about the amazing
potential of the Web.

978
00:39:23,033 --> 00:39:26,300
And by the way, this is
both if you're on a desktop

979
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,367
or if you're
on a mobile device,

980
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:31,701
when I showed you
on the Android and iPhone here,

981
00:39:31,701 --> 00:39:35,667
Wave was running in the browser
in both of those phones.

982
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:37,434
GWT makes that
fairly easy to do.

983
00:39:37,434 --> 00:39:39,534
It's actually
the same code

984
00:39:39,534 --> 00:39:41,868
that runs
in those mobile devices,

985
00:39:41,868 --> 00:39:43,467
it's just a different layout.

986
00:39:43,467 --> 00:39:46,868
We estimate that the extra
requirement of serving this

987
00:39:46,868 --> 00:39:49,767
both into desktop browsers
and mobile browsers

988
00:39:49,767 --> 00:39:52,667
only adds about 5% extra
engineering effort,

989
00:39:52,667 --> 00:39:56,067
which I find remarkable.

990
00:39:56,067 --> 00:39:57,400
Okay.

991
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,734
Hannon: And that graph
from yesterday.

992
00:39:58,734 --> 00:40:00,000
Lars Rasmussen: Pardon me.

993
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,667
Oh, the graph from yesterday.
Did you see that?

994
00:40:01,667 --> 00:40:04,367
How we built 1.4 megs of code
and then all of a sudden

995
00:40:04,367 --> 00:40:06,367
it went down to 200k?

996
00:40:06,367 --> 00:40:09,934
We like GWT for that.

997
00:40:09,934 --> 00:40:13,534
[applause]

998
00:40:13,534 --> 00:40:15,667
Hannon: All right.
So back to the demo.

999
00:40:15,667 --> 00:40:17,934
Let's talk
about organization.

1000
00:40:17,934 --> 00:40:20,033
We learned from our own use
of Wave

1001
00:40:20,033 --> 00:40:23,300
that you get a lot of waves,
which is great,

1002
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,501
but you need tools
to organize them.

1003
00:40:25,501 --> 00:40:26,934
We have things
you're familiar with

1004
00:40:26,934 --> 00:40:29,434
like folders
and saved searches.

1005
00:40:29,434 --> 00:40:31,534
We also have tags
and they're shared

1006
00:40:31,534 --> 00:40:34,067
by all the participants
on the wave.

1007
00:40:34,067 --> 00:40:35,801
So you have
just as much incentive

1008
00:40:35,801 --> 00:40:39,300
to put a great tag on a wave
as a great subject.

1009
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,300
For example,
Lars is way too lazy

1010
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,601
to organize his own stuff.

1011
00:40:42,601 --> 00:40:43,734
Lars Rasmussen: Oh, yeah.

1012
00:40:43,734 --> 00:40:46,067
Hannon: So we have a team
help him do it.

1013
00:40:46,067 --> 00:40:48,567
Lars Rasmussen: Thank you.
Hannon: [laughs]

1014
00:40:48,567 --> 00:40:50,667
But the most powerful way
to organize waves

1015
00:40:50,667 --> 00:40:52,667
is with waves themselves.

1016
00:40:52,667 --> 00:40:55,734
Let me open a wave we used
to organize this demo.

1017
00:40:55,734 --> 00:40:57,934
You can see it has links
to other waves in it

1018
00:40:57,934 --> 00:41:01,367
and you can combine, uh, them
in sections, formatting.

1019
00:41:01,367 --> 00:41:03,100
You can discuss them.

1020
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,601
And if I click
on one of these links,

1021
00:41:05,601 --> 00:41:07,467
it'll take me to that wave

1022
00:41:07,467 --> 00:41:10,400
and I can use the back button
to go back.

1023
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,167
So let me show you
how easy it is

1024
00:41:12,167 --> 00:41:14,367
to create one
of these wave links.

1025
00:41:14,367 --> 00:41:17,033
If I missed one,
I can just pick it up

1026
00:41:17,033 --> 00:41:20,100
from the search panel
and drop it in.

1027
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:25,167
[applause]

1028
00:41:25,167 --> 00:41:28,767
I'll do that one more time
'cause I think it's cool.

1029
00:41:28,767 --> 00:41:30,367
Drop it in.

1030
00:41:30,367 --> 00:41:32,234
So we found
on our own team

1031
00:41:32,234 --> 00:41:34,567
links--wave links are good
for more than just lists.

1032
00:41:34,567 --> 00:41:37,601
We're actually interlinking
a lot of waves on our site

1033
00:41:37,601 --> 00:41:40,834
almost like a Wiki,
uh, on our team.

1034
00:41:40,834 --> 00:41:42,467
Before we get
to Wave extensions,

1035
00:41:42,467 --> 00:41:44,801
which I know this audience
is really excited about,

1036
00:41:44,801 --> 00:41:46,300
I want to show you
one more thing

1037
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,400
that we worked
really hard on.

1038
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,000
I'm going to go up here
and search for Google Wave.

1039
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,834
Lars Rasmussen: I have
a feeling, uh, you're going

1040
00:41:52,834 --> 00:41:55,234
to want to refresh your browser
before we do this.

1041
00:41:55,234 --> 00:41:59,167
Hannon: Just like my inbox,
when a wave matches this search,

1042
00:41:59,167 --> 00:42:03,334
it will pop into the panel.

1043
00:42:03,334 --> 00:42:04,968
Lars Rasmussen: And so Stephanie
has a search

1044
00:42:04,968 --> 00:42:06,000
for Google Wave over there.

1045
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,567
I'm teeing up
a new wave here.

1046
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:09,634
Said, "Wow.

1047
00:42:09,634 --> 00:42:15,701
I am finally demo-ing
Google Wave."

1048
00:42:15,701 --> 00:42:17,234
Now the reason this hasn't
showed up

1049
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:20,834
in Stephanie's search yet
is I didn't type the E.

1050
00:42:20,834 --> 00:42:22,868
So what I'm going to do,
I'm going to count to three,

1051
00:42:22,868 --> 00:42:24,133
then I'm going to hit the E,

1052
00:42:24,133 --> 00:42:26,334
and you guys can count
how many seconds it takes

1053
00:42:26,334 --> 00:42:28,934
before it shows up
in Stephanie's browser.

1054
00:42:28,934 --> 00:42:32,467
One, two, three.

1055
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:37,400
[applause]

1056
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,400
You guys want to--
you guys want to see that again?

1057
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,934
[laughter]

1058
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:44,167
Hey, Stephanie, can you open up
that wave for me?

1059
00:42:44,167 --> 00:42:45,634
Hannon: All right,
let me go over there.

1060
00:42:45,634 --> 00:42:46,968
Lars Rasmussen:
Backspace.

1061
00:42:46,968 --> 00:42:48,300
Hannon: [laughs]

1062
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:51,167
[laughter and applause]

1063
00:42:51,167 --> 00:42:53,634
Lars Rasmussen:
E, backspace, E,

1064
00:42:53,634 --> 00:42:57,000
backspace, E, backspace, E,
backspace.

1065
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,734
We call that the Wave dance.

1066
00:43:00,734 --> 00:43:02,067
So we've worked really hard
on this.

1067
00:43:02,067 --> 00:43:03,434
We're pretty proud
of the result.

1068
00:43:03,434 --> 00:43:06,033
I should just say
after we started using it,

1069
00:43:06,033 --> 00:43:07,634
we found
this is almost too fast.

1070
00:43:07,634 --> 00:43:09,567
Sometimes, uh, it draws
your attention

1071
00:43:09,567 --> 00:43:10,934
to unfinished work.

1072
00:43:10,934 --> 00:43:12,868
And we're actually looking
for the right balance

1073
00:43:12,868 --> 00:43:17,767
between speed and not being
interrupted too often.

1074
00:43:17,767 --> 00:43:19,367
Okay, what's next?

1075
00:43:19,367 --> 00:43:22,000
Hannon: Extensions.
Lars Rasmussen: Extensions.

1076
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,801
The reasons
you guys came here.

1077
00:43:24,801 --> 00:43:27,234
Okay. So the next thing
we want to show

1078
00:43:27,234 --> 00:43:30,200
is the other category
of APIs

1079
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,634
that we're
making available today,

1080
00:43:31,634 --> 00:43:35,133
which is about extending
the functionality of Wave.

1081
00:43:35,133 --> 00:43:37,734
So we have tried hard
to maintain a discipline

1082
00:43:37,734 --> 00:43:40,567
on the team
that even significant offerings

1083
00:43:40,567 --> 00:43:43,868
of our own should be built
with our own extension APIs

1084
00:43:43,868 --> 00:43:45,601
so that your extensions
will live

1085
00:43:45,601 --> 00:43:47,701
as first-class citizens
inside Wave.

1086
00:43:47,701 --> 00:43:51,634
It's similar, actually,
to how browsers like Firefox

1087
00:43:51,634 --> 00:43:52,801
let you extend them.

1088
00:43:52,801 --> 00:43:54,467
This is just the web site
you're extending

1089
00:43:54,467 --> 00:43:55,634
instead of the browser.

1090
00:43:55,634 --> 00:43:58,567
So let me show you
some examples.

1091
00:43:58,567 --> 00:44:00,701
You've undoubtedly noticed
how all morning,

1092
00:44:00,701 --> 00:44:03,234
I've been pretending
my spelling is bad

1093
00:44:03,234 --> 00:44:06,033
just so that we could show off
our spell-checker.

1094
00:44:06,033 --> 00:44:07,367
So normally
spell-checkers work

1095
00:44:07,367 --> 00:44:09,968
by matching words up
against a dictionary.

1096
00:44:09,968 --> 00:44:11,834
If they find there's--
if they don't find a word

1097
00:44:11,834 --> 00:44:12,834
that is in error,

1098
00:44:12,834 --> 00:44:14,234
the problem is
that oftentimes

1099
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:16,534
spelling mistakes
hits other dictionary words.

1100
00:44:16,534 --> 00:44:19,601
And so our spell-checker
actually takes the context

1101
00:44:19,601 --> 00:44:21,400
of the word into account

1102
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,667
and then it matches it up

1103
00:44:22,667 --> 00:44:24,501
against an enormous
language model

1104
00:44:24,501 --> 00:44:26,434
that we've built
from the entire web.

1105
00:44:26,434 --> 00:44:29,200
Let me show you
how powerful that is.

1106
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,968
We call this
the "Bean Soup Demo."

1107
00:44:32,968 --> 00:44:38,000
"Can I have some been soup?"

1108
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,567
It puts a red on the line

1109
00:44:39,567 --> 00:44:42,734
and it knows that I meant
"bean soup."

1110
00:44:42,734 --> 00:44:43,734
Thank you.

1111
00:44:43,734 --> 00:44:47,901
[applause]

1112
00:44:47,901 --> 00:44:49,501
Okay, now watch carefully.

1113
00:44:49,501 --> 00:44:54,667
"It has bean so long."

1114
00:44:54,667 --> 00:44:59,067
Did you see that?

1115
00:44:59,067 --> 00:45:02,634
So it is--it has become
so good at spell-checking

1116
00:45:02,634 --> 00:45:04,767
that often,
it has enough confidence

1117
00:45:04,767 --> 00:45:07,434
that we let it automatically
correct my errors.

1118
00:45:07,434 --> 00:45:10,934
Let me show you that again.

1119
00:45:10,934 --> 00:45:15,868
"Icland is an icland."

1120
00:45:15,868 --> 00:45:20,133
[applause]

1121
00:45:22,501 --> 00:45:25,701
"You are to kind."

1122
00:45:29,667 --> 00:45:31,801
Pretty cool, huh?
[laughs]

1123
00:45:31,801 --> 00:45:33,033
You didn't see
that last one.

1124
00:45:33,033 --> 00:45:35,200
Okay, so that's
our spell-checker,

1125
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,367
or Spelly as we
affectionately call it.

1126
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:38,767
Let me show you another
simpler one

1127
00:45:38,767 --> 00:45:41,534
that detects links
in what you're typing.

1128
00:45:41,534 --> 00:45:42,968
And we call it Linky.

1129
00:45:42,968 --> 00:45:47,300
"I love google.com."

1130
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:50,000
It immediately puts
an underline--.a--

1131
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,167
ooh, that's not a link--
.u--now it's a link again.

1132
00:45:54,167 --> 00:45:58,434
[applause]

1133
00:45:58,434 --> 00:45:59,968
You're wondering
what's this all got to do

1134
00:45:59,968 --> 00:46:02,000
with extensions
and let me explain that.

1135
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,100
So you remember
we showed you a robot earlier

1136
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:05,534
called "Bloggy."

1137
00:46:05,534 --> 00:46:08,100
All that one did
was publish a blog

1138
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,033
that let you use
the embedding API.

1139
00:46:10,033 --> 00:46:11,634
But robots
are really powerful ways

1140
00:46:11,634 --> 00:46:13,234
of extending Wave's
functionality.

1141
00:46:13,234 --> 00:46:17,234
They're server-side programs
that participate in Wave

1142
00:46:17,234 --> 00:46:19,901
with all the power
of the human participants.

1143
00:46:19,901 --> 00:46:22,801
You can see from your robot
the live changes in the wave.

1144
00:46:22,801 --> 00:46:24,801
You can make live changes
to the wave

1145
00:46:24,801 --> 00:46:26,834
including adding
and removing messages,

1146
00:46:26,834 --> 00:46:28,434
collaboratively edited
messaging,

1147
00:46:28,434 --> 00:46:30,033
adding and removing
participants.

1148
00:46:30,033 --> 00:46:33,234
You can even start new waves
from robots.

1149
00:46:33,234 --> 00:46:34,901
And the way Spelly works

1150
00:46:34,901 --> 00:46:38,200
is that it uses our robot APIs
to watch what I'm typing.

1151
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,901
It sits on the server.
It watches what I'm typing.

1152
00:46:40,901 --> 00:46:43,033
It takes every so many words
and matches it up

1153
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:45,300
against a language model.

1154
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,667
And then when it finds
an error,

1155
00:46:46,667 --> 00:46:50,300
it uses collaborative editing
to edit the content.

1156
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,367
And in fact, when it doesn't
have enough confidence

1157
00:46:52,367 --> 00:46:54,434
and it put
that red underline,

1158
00:46:54,434 --> 00:46:56,868
if Steph and I were editing
the message at the same time,

1159
00:46:56,868 --> 00:46:58,667
she would also see
the red underline

1160
00:46:58,667 --> 00:47:01,968
and she could be the one
taking the suggestion.

1161
00:47:01,968 --> 00:47:05,167
Linky works
in the same way.

1162
00:47:05,167 --> 00:47:08,701
But who wants
to be typing in links all day?

1163
00:47:08,701 --> 00:47:10,100
We had a very good friend
of ours

1164
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:13,033
from the Google Search Team
build this extension for us here

1165
00:47:13,033 --> 00:47:15,033
called Searchy.

1166
00:47:15,033 --> 00:47:16,300
Let's search for Australia.

1167
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:19,100
Hannon: We have a really clever
naming convention.

1168
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:20,901
Lars Rasmussen: And here
you can do a Google search

1169
00:47:20,901 --> 00:47:24,667
from right inside Wave
and add the link like that.

1170
00:47:24,667 --> 00:47:28,634
[applause]

1171
00:47:28,634 --> 00:47:30,267
You guys want
to see that again?

1172
00:47:30,267 --> 00:47:33,567
I search for Bora Bora.
It's so pretty there.

1173
00:47:33,567 --> 00:47:36,601
I add an image to the wave
just like that.

1174
00:47:36,601 --> 00:47:38,267
Thank you.

1175
00:47:38,267 --> 00:47:41,267
[applause]

1176
00:47:41,267 --> 00:47:44,067
Let me just quickly return
to our friend Linky.

1177
00:47:44,067 --> 00:47:46,334
I've got a video
sitting here.

1178
00:47:46,334 --> 00:47:49,868
Let me copy the URL.

1179
00:47:49,868 --> 00:47:51,667
And inside my wave,

1180
00:47:51,667 --> 00:47:55,434
I'm going to type
"Check this out."

1181
00:47:55,434 --> 00:47:58,601
And then I'm going to copy
the link in there.

1182
00:47:58,601 --> 00:48:01,133
And then I'm going to dance
a little bit

1183
00:48:01,133 --> 00:48:04,467
while the system
spectacularly fails.

1184
00:48:04,467 --> 00:48:07,434
[laughter]

1185
00:48:07,434 --> 00:48:10,934
Maybe we'll return
to that later.

1186
00:48:10,934 --> 00:48:13,634
Okay, so that's extensions
that we built

1187
00:48:13,634 --> 00:48:15,133
with internal APIs.

1188
00:48:15,133 --> 00:48:17,234
And what we're doing today
as part of the developer preview

1189
00:48:17,234 --> 00:48:21,567
is--is make external versions
of these APIs

1190
00:48:21,567 --> 00:48:23,334
available to you guys.

1191
00:48:23,334 --> 00:48:25,968
The external APIs
have almost all the power

1192
00:48:25,968 --> 00:48:27,367
of the internal APIs.

1193
00:48:27,367 --> 00:48:29,501
There is a few things
we haven't quite figured out

1194
00:48:29,501 --> 00:48:31,400
how to secure the export.

1195
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,400
We're working very hard
to close the gap.

1196
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:37,501
We're going to show you now
a series of examples

1197
00:48:37,501 --> 00:48:39,601
of things that are built
with the external APIs.

1198
00:48:39,601 --> 00:48:41,267
These are all sample codes

1199
00:48:41,267 --> 00:48:43,434
that are going
to be on code.google.com

1200
00:48:43,434 --> 00:48:45,667
where we'll host the API.

1201
00:48:45,667 --> 00:48:48,167
Stephanie.

1202
00:48:48,167 --> 00:48:51,167
Hannon: Any open social gadget
can sit inside a wave.

1203
00:48:51,167 --> 00:48:52,901
In fact, we were about
to show you one

1204
00:48:52,901 --> 00:48:55,100
which might come
a little bit later.

1205
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:58,000
But we also make
an additional API available

1206
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,834
that lets you the developer
make your gadget

1207
00:49:00,834 --> 00:49:02,534
live and collaborative.

1208
00:49:02,534 --> 00:49:04,033
I want to show you that.

1209
00:49:04,033 --> 00:49:07,767
But before I do, I'll digress
and tell you a little story.

1210
00:49:07,767 --> 00:49:10,234
Even though we on this team
have been building Wave

1211
00:49:10,234 --> 00:49:12,067
and thinking about Wave
for a year and a half,

1212
00:49:12,067 --> 00:49:14,701
when we first started
using it ourselves,

1213
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:17,367
it took awhile for us
to discover all the ways

1214
00:49:17,367 --> 00:49:19,367
Wave can make you
more productive

1215
00:49:19,367 --> 00:49:21,868
because we were so used
to older tools.

1216
00:49:21,868 --> 00:49:25,100
In fact, we're still discovering
new ways all the time.

1217
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:27,501
I'll show you that
by opening a wave

1218
00:49:27,501 --> 00:49:31,033
and using Playback
to tell you what happened.

1219
00:49:31,033 --> 00:49:33,467
Uh, someone on our team
wanted to create a movie outing

1220
00:49:33,467 --> 00:49:35,868
and we should all go see
the <i>Transformers.</i>

1221
00:49:35,868 --> 00:49:37,968
So he sent a wave out
and people did something

1222
00:49:37,968 --> 00:49:40,400
very email-like
and responded.

1223
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,100
"I'm interested."
"What place are you going to?"

1224
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:45,501
"Is that really a good movie?"
And so on.

1225
00:49:45,501 --> 00:49:49,868
I tried to get them to see
 <i>Confessions of a Shopaholic.</i>

1226
00:49:49,868 --> 00:49:50,934
Nobody went for that.

1227
00:49:50,934 --> 00:49:52,234
Lars Rasmussen:
She's still trying.

1228
00:49:52,234 --> 00:49:53,501
Hannon: Still trying.

1229
00:49:53,501 --> 00:49:55,000
So when you look
at this wave,

1230
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,067
it's sort of hard to parse out
the important information

1231
00:49:57,067 --> 00:49:58,467
of who wants to go.

1232
00:49:58,467 --> 00:50:00,934
So somebody suggested
we should all edit

1233
00:50:00,934 --> 00:50:02,934
the opening message
instead of putting it

1234
00:50:02,934 --> 00:50:05,267
in individual messages.

1235
00:50:05,267 --> 00:50:06,567
And we cleaned up the wave.

1236
00:50:06,567 --> 00:50:12,000
Everyone started editing
the opening message and so on.

1237
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,100
This was a much better way
to construct this RSVP list.

1238
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:17,501
And we could still have
discussions

1239
00:50:17,501 --> 00:50:20,634
about which car to take
and so on.

1240
00:50:20,634 --> 00:50:22,234
Now, we're all engineers,

1241
00:50:22,234 --> 00:50:23,667
and you can look
at this workflow

1242
00:50:23,667 --> 00:50:25,634
and think
there are better ways

1243
00:50:25,634 --> 00:50:27,901
or there are ways
to make this even better

1244
00:50:27,901 --> 00:50:29,567
using our extensions.

1245
00:50:29,567 --> 00:50:32,234
So another engineer
on our team wrote a gadget.

1246
00:50:35,767 --> 00:50:39,601
We call this
the "yes-no-maybe gadget."

1247
00:50:39,601 --> 00:50:41,334
Hey. [laughs]

1248
00:50:41,334 --> 00:50:44,734
[applause]

1249
00:50:44,734 --> 00:50:46,834
So if you--it's hard to see
for you guys, I know.

1250
00:50:46,834 --> 00:50:48,834
But I'm currently in "No"
in the middle column

1251
00:50:48,834 --> 00:50:51,767
and I'm to change it
to "Maybe."

1252
00:50:51,767 --> 00:50:54,634
And you see it update
on Lars' screen.

1253
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:56,501
[applause]

1254
00:50:56,501 --> 00:50:57,734
Lars Rasmussen:
And I'm currently

1255
00:50:57,734 --> 00:50:58,734
in the "Maybe" column.

1256
00:50:58,734 --> 00:50:59,868
And I click
the "Yes" over here.

1257
00:50:59,868 --> 00:51:01,234
And you'll see
it quickly updates

1258
00:51:01,234 --> 00:51:03,234
on both our screens.

1259
00:51:03,234 --> 00:51:04,667
Hannon: So you
the gadget developer

1260
00:51:04,667 --> 00:51:07,267
only have to worry
about two things.

1261
00:51:07,267 --> 00:51:08,834
When I click the button,

1262
00:51:08,834 --> 00:51:12,701
update the state of the gadget
in XML and the wave,

1263
00:51:12,701 --> 00:51:15,367
then we automatically transmit
through the server

1264
00:51:15,367 --> 00:51:18,100
to Lars' client
where your gadget

1265
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:21,300
has to update the UI
to reflect the new state.

1266
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,033
Now, of course we did
all this--

1267
00:51:25,033 --> 00:51:27,267
ooh, it's a secret though--

1268
00:51:27,267 --> 00:51:29,133
I, um, uh, don't tell anyone,

1269
00:51:29,133 --> 00:51:30,534
but we did all this
so we could build

1270
00:51:30,534 --> 00:51:32,701
impossibly fun,
addictive games.

1271
00:51:32,701 --> 00:51:34,901
And we'll show you
a few of those now.

1272
00:51:34,901 --> 00:51:37,968
Lars and I are going
to open Sudoku.

1273
00:51:37,968 --> 00:51:40,567
Lars Rasmussen: Hmm. Hmm.

1274
00:51:40,567 --> 00:51:42,868
Hannon: And we intended for this
to be a collaborative game

1275
00:51:42,868 --> 00:51:44,667
so we could solve
the puzzle together,

1276
00:51:44,667 --> 00:51:46,734
but somehow it turned
competitive.

1277
00:51:46,734 --> 00:51:47,901
[laughter]

1278
00:51:47,901 --> 00:51:51,033
And, uh, you get a point
for making a good move

1279
00:51:51,033 --> 00:51:53,667
and a negative point
for doing something wrong.

1280
00:51:53,667 --> 00:51:56,667
You can see Lars' score
is going negative.

1281
00:51:56,667 --> 00:51:58,000
Lars Rasmussen:
How can you play Sudoku

1282
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,033
in front of 4,000 people?

1283
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:00,133
Come on.

1284
00:52:00,133 --> 00:52:02,267
Hannon:
Then, uh, back in 1851,

1285
00:52:02,267 --> 00:52:04,067
Lars and I
played this chess game

1286
00:52:04,067 --> 00:52:05,734
that became very famous.

1287
00:52:05,734 --> 00:52:07,667
It ended in 23 moves.

1288
00:52:07,667 --> 00:52:11,501
And it illustrates how well
Playback works with gadgets.

1289
00:52:11,501 --> 00:52:15,167
So if I go into playback
and I click forward,

1290
00:52:15,167 --> 00:52:18,167
you can actually step through
the whole game.

1291
00:52:18,167 --> 00:52:21,767
[applause]

1292
00:52:27,267 --> 00:52:28,968
So as we mentioned
in the beginning,

1293
00:52:28,968 --> 00:52:30,167
we come from the Maps team.

1294
00:52:30,167 --> 00:52:32,100
So probably wouldn't be
a good demo

1295
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:34,767
if we didn't do
a Maps gadget as well.

1296
00:52:34,767 --> 00:52:36,901
It's been a lot of work
to prepare for this demo.

1297
00:52:36,901 --> 00:52:40,334
So I'm going to send Lars a wave
about taking a vacation.

1298
00:52:40,334 --> 00:52:41,901
Lars Rasmussen:
Stephanie's favorite topic.

1299
00:52:41,901 --> 00:52:43,801
She wants to go on vacation
in Bora Bora.

1300
00:52:43,801 --> 00:52:46,000
She's asking me
for recommendations.

1301
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,033
I highlight the term
Bora Bora here.

1302
00:52:48,033 --> 00:52:50,267
And then I click this button
that's provided

1303
00:52:50,267 --> 00:52:52,801
by an extension
that you guys could've written

1304
00:52:52,801 --> 00:52:56,734
that inserts a map
to Bora Bora.

1305
00:52:56,734 --> 00:52:58,467
Thank you.
[applause]

1306
00:52:58,467 --> 00:52:59,667
Hannon: Now,
the important thing

1307
00:52:59,667 --> 00:53:01,567
is my hands are off
of my computer,

1308
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:03,300
but my screen is still
on the right.

1309
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:05,100
Lars Rasmussen: And now I click
the satellite button

1310
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:06,767
and it changes
on both screens.

1311
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:12,501
And I go zoom, zoom,
zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom.

1312
00:53:12,501 --> 00:53:14,167
[applause]

1313
00:53:14,167 --> 00:53:17,234
[laughs]
Thank you.

1314
00:53:17,234 --> 00:53:20,901
[applause]

1315
00:53:20,901 --> 00:53:24,601
And now, Stephanie loves
swimming with sharks.

1316
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:26,667
And I happen to know
that the lemon sharks hang

1317
00:53:26,667 --> 00:53:28,200
over here.

1318
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:31,567
And you can see
that I put that marker on.

1319
00:53:31,567 --> 00:53:33,501
Shows up live
over on Stephanie's screen.

1320
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:34,667
Now my hands are off.

1321
00:53:34,667 --> 00:53:36,300
Hannon: And I'll pick up
the polygon tool

1322
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:39,033
and I'll tell Lars, actually,
I want to stay in this area.

1323
00:53:39,033 --> 00:53:41,968
Lars Rasmussen: And you see that
showing up on my screen too.

1324
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:44,400
And so again, all you guys
have to do with your gadgets

1325
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,567
is to store updates
to the state

1326
00:53:46,567 --> 00:53:48,300
in the local XML.

1327
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:49,767
And then we transmit
on the wire

1328
00:53:49,767 --> 00:53:51,701
and then the other instance
of your gadget

1329
00:53:51,701 --> 00:53:54,434
just updates its state
when it gets notified

1330
00:53:54,434 --> 00:53:57,334
of that change.

1331
00:53:57,334 --> 00:54:01,334
And so those are client-side,
um, extensions.

1332
00:54:01,334 --> 00:54:02,767
I want to just show you,
actually,

1333
00:54:02,767 --> 00:54:05,167
the team in blue over here
is scrambled.

1334
00:54:05,167 --> 00:54:07,067
And they brought back up
Linky.

1335
00:54:07,067 --> 00:54:08,934
And I wanted to show you
what happened

1336
00:54:08,934 --> 00:54:13,501
when I dropped that YouTube URL
into the old extension wave.

1337
00:54:13,501 --> 00:54:15,868
So you'll see that Linky
didn't just recognize

1338
00:54:15,868 --> 00:54:17,067
it was a link,

1339
00:54:17,067 --> 00:54:19,534
but it recognized
it was a link to a video.

1340
00:54:19,534 --> 00:54:21,868
It puts this
little friendly light bulb

1341
00:54:21,868 --> 00:54:23,934
on my screen
where I can open up

1342
00:54:23,934 --> 00:54:26,767
a set of suggestions
for what I might want to do.

1343
00:54:26,767 --> 00:54:29,701
Like, for example,
I might want to embed the video

1344
00:54:29,701 --> 00:54:32,367
right inside my wave

1345
00:54:32,367 --> 00:54:35,801
and play it for you guys.

1346
00:54:35,801 --> 00:54:38,100
[wobbling noise]

1347
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:40,300
Dah nah.
Pretty cool, huh?

1348
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:43,234
[applause]

1349
00:54:46,501 --> 00:54:48,400
Thank you.

1350
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,567
Okay. What's next?

1351
00:54:50,567 --> 00:54:52,667
So Stephanie showed you
a bunch of gadgets.

1352
00:54:52,667 --> 00:54:55,234
They're all client-side
extensions.

1353
00:54:55,234 --> 00:54:57,267
We want to show you next
what you can do

1354
00:54:57,267 --> 00:54:59,434
on a server side
with robots.

1355
00:54:59,434 --> 00:55:01,434
And we're going to show you
three examples.

1356
00:55:01,434 --> 00:55:03,834
The first one
is an application--

1357
00:55:03,834 --> 00:55:06,701
a collaborative application
built entirely within Wave

1358
00:55:06,701 --> 00:55:09,367
with our extension API.

1359
00:55:09,367 --> 00:55:11,601
So let me just open up
my inbox again.

1360
00:55:11,601 --> 00:55:13,534
And instead of clicking
"new wave,"

1361
00:55:13,534 --> 00:55:15,601
I'm going to hit
this drop-down button here.

1362
00:55:15,601 --> 00:55:16,934
And I'm going
to hit this item

1363
00:55:16,934 --> 00:55:18,667
called a "new poll."

1364
00:55:18,667 --> 00:55:21,033
New poll
is just a new wave,

1365
00:55:21,033 --> 00:55:24,501
but with a special robot
that comes from an extension

1366
00:55:24,501 --> 00:55:28,901
that you guys could build
called Polly the Pollster.

1367
00:55:28,901 --> 00:55:31,567
I'll add Steph
to the wave as well.

1368
00:55:31,567 --> 00:55:35,067
Polly added a form
to the wave.

1369
00:55:35,067 --> 00:55:37,334
Yes. And so this is not
a gadget.

1370
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:39,300
Forms are native to wave.

1371
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:40,667
You can put them in there.

1372
00:55:40,667 --> 00:55:42,667
And now
I can fill out the form

1373
00:55:42,667 --> 00:55:44,634
starting with the title
of the poll

1374
00:55:44,634 --> 00:55:46,267
that I want to conduct.

1375
00:55:46,267 --> 00:55:49,634
And you'll see
as I'm typing in the form,

1376
00:55:49,634 --> 00:55:51,300
Polly sits
on the server side.

1377
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:52,934
She saw that
letter by letter,

1378
00:55:52,934 --> 00:55:56,400
and she updated
the title of the wave.

1379
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,868
Now the really cool thing
about having forms in waves

1380
00:55:58,868 --> 00:56:01,167
is that you can fill them out
collaboratively.

1381
00:56:01,167 --> 00:56:03,601
So Stephanie's going
to fill in the choices

1382
00:56:03,601 --> 00:56:05,934
while I add
the question here.

1383
00:56:05,934 --> 00:56:10,434
"Which movie
is the best ever?"

1384
00:56:10,434 --> 00:56:13,167
And you see that Stephanie's
filling in the options

1385
00:56:13,167 --> 00:56:15,234
in the field below.

1386
00:56:15,234 --> 00:56:17,834
Hannon: <i>Star Wars.</i>

1387
00:56:17,834 --> 00:56:21,167
Lars Rasmussen: Star Wave.
[laughs]

1388
00:56:21,167 --> 00:56:24,000
Hannon: Not on purpose.
[laughs]

1389
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,534
Lars Rasmussen: <i>Confessions</i>
 <i>of a Shopaholic.</i>

1390
00:56:25,534 --> 00:56:28,200
So now Stephanie's going
to fill out a number of people

1391
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,167
that we're going
to send the poll to

1392
00:56:30,167 --> 00:56:31,934
in the recipient list there.

1393
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
She's putting in--

1394
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,100
Hannon: Done.

1395
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:39,634
Lars Rasmussen: Putting in
six of them.

1396
00:56:39,634 --> 00:56:42,100
Now I'll hit the button here
that says "distribute poll."

1397
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:43,834
Now, what happens is
that Polly sees

1398
00:56:43,834 --> 00:56:45,234
that I hit that button.

1399
00:56:45,234 --> 00:56:48,000
She fills in
a results section

1400
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
in that same wave here.

1401
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,334
And then she sends out
fresh waves

1402
00:56:52,334 --> 00:56:54,400
with the questions
we specified

1403
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,200
to all the recipients
we specified.

1404
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:58,300
And Stephanie's
one of them.

1405
00:56:58,300 --> 00:56:59,534
Hannon: So I'm going
to answer the poll

1406
00:56:59,534 --> 00:57:01,400
that <i>Star Trek's</i> my favorite.

1407
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,968
Lars Rasmussen: And you'll see
that Polly updates the results

1408
00:57:03,968 --> 00:57:07,434
live in the admin wave.

1409
00:57:07,434 --> 00:57:09,767
With a bit of luck--
thank you.

1410
00:57:09,767 --> 00:57:15,100
[applause]

1411
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:17,601
Okay. So that's the--
an example of an extension

1412
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:21,767
built exclusively inside
of Wave.

1413
00:57:21,767 --> 00:57:24,334
The next type of extension
we want to demonstrate for you

1414
00:57:24,334 --> 00:57:27,534
are extensions
that integrate Wave

1415
00:57:27,534 --> 00:57:29,234
with existent
communication systems.

1416
00:57:29,234 --> 00:57:31,734
In this case, we'll show you
with everyone's favorite

1417
00:57:31,734 --> 00:57:35,601
microblogging service,
Twitter.

1418
00:57:35,601 --> 00:57:37,434
Hannon: So at this point,
you're probably wondering

1419
00:57:37,434 --> 00:57:39,334
how to install
these extensions.

1420
00:57:39,334 --> 00:57:41,334
So let me open a wave.

1421
00:57:41,334 --> 00:57:42,934
And you probably
won't be surprised to hear

1422
00:57:42,934 --> 00:57:45,501
that extensions can live
inside a wave.

1423
00:57:45,501 --> 00:57:47,133
Here's their--a bunch
of puzzle pieces

1424
00:57:47,133 --> 00:57:51,100
showing some of the things
we're using today.

1425
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,501
All I have to do if I want
to use one of these inst--

1426
00:57:53,501 --> 00:57:55,400
extensious--is--

1427
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:59,200
Sorry.
Click the "install" button.

1428
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:02,868
And you can see over here,
there's a new drop-down menu.

1429
00:58:02,868 --> 00:58:05,300
And I have the option
to create a new twave.

1430
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:07,367
Lars Rasmussen: A wave,
of course--twave, of course,

1431
00:58:07,367 --> 00:58:10,234
is a wave of tweets.

1432
00:58:10,234 --> 00:58:11,968
Hannon: You can describe
as a developer

1433
00:58:11,968 --> 00:58:14,067
how your extensions
hook into Wave.

1434
00:58:14,067 --> 00:58:15,801
It could be
a keyboard shortcut,

1435
00:58:15,801 --> 00:58:17,300
a button on the tool bar.

1436
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:19,567
It could be something
like a new twave button.

1437
00:58:19,567 --> 00:58:20,934
There'll be
a confirmation page

1438
00:58:20,934 --> 00:58:23,000
that tells the users
how you're going to interact.

1439
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,067
We haven't quite implemented
that yet.

1440
00:58:26,067 --> 00:58:28,100
So let me log in here.

1441
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:30,767
I have to tell you that Lars
created my Twitter account.

1442
00:58:30,767 --> 00:58:32,734
Lars Rasmussen:
I made her Twiffanie.

1443
00:58:32,734 --> 00:58:35,334
She hates that.

1444
00:58:35,334 --> 00:58:36,934
Hannon: [laughs]

1445
00:58:36,934 --> 00:58:40,033
Lars Rasmussen: She's Twiffanie
at Twitter.

1446
00:58:40,033 --> 00:58:42,801
Hannon: I think that tab button
should be implemented, you guys.

1447
00:58:42,801 --> 00:58:44,734
[laughs]

1448
00:58:44,734 --> 00:58:48,067
I feel like all sorts
of bad stuff is about to happen.

1449
00:58:48,067 --> 00:58:50,767
[laughs]

1450
00:58:50,767 --> 00:58:53,501
All right, so I'll sign in
to Twitter.

1451
00:58:57,234 --> 00:58:58,734
And you can see tweets

1452
00:58:58,734 --> 00:59:01,601
from all the famous people
I follow.

1453
00:59:01,601 --> 00:59:03,868
And down here at the bottom,
Lars.

1454
00:59:03,868 --> 00:59:05,701
Lars Rasmussen: No.

1455
00:59:05,701 --> 00:59:06,968
Hannon: I'm just going
to close it.

1456
00:59:06,968 --> 00:59:09,067
We still haven't,
uh, uh...

1457
00:59:10,968 --> 00:59:13,100
I wanted
to get the contacts out.

1458
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:17,067
Um, it's important you can see
that each of these avatars,

1459
00:59:17,067 --> 00:59:19,601
they're not necessarily
Wave users.

1460
00:59:19,601 --> 00:59:22,434
Through our APIs,
you can be a proxy

1461
00:59:22,434 --> 00:59:24,701
for contacts
on a different system.

1462
00:59:24,701 --> 00:59:27,067
So I have Lance Armstrong,
Ryan Seacrest,

1463
00:59:27,067 --> 00:59:28,834
lots of different people.

1464
00:59:28,834 --> 00:59:32,968
If I go down here
and I look for Lars' tweet,

1465
00:59:32,968 --> 00:59:34,200
I can respond to it.

1466
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:37,734
He says, "The demo's going
pretty well."

1467
00:59:37,734 --> 00:59:41,834
And I'll say,
"It ain't over yet."

1468
00:59:41,834 --> 00:59:42,934
[laughs]

1469
00:59:42,934 --> 00:59:44,300
Lars Rasmussen: And now
I've logged in

1470
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:46,634
to Twiffanie at Twitter
over here.

1471
00:59:46,634 --> 00:59:48,501
And if I refresh the page,

1472
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:52,300
you'll see that the extension
took Stephanie's wave reply

1473
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:55,000
and tweeted it.

1474
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,334
Thank you.

1475
00:59:56,334 --> 00:59:59,067
[applause]

1476
00:59:59,067 --> 01:00:01,067
Hannon: Now Tweety
also lets you search

1477
01:00:01,067 --> 01:00:03,267
over the public timeline
of Twitter.

1478
01:00:03,267 --> 01:00:06,701
For example,
for a phrase like "Google Wave."

1479
01:00:06,701 --> 01:00:09,801
So I'm going to start
a new twave.

1480
01:00:09,801 --> 01:00:11,801
Lars Rasmussen: You're going
to search for Google Wave now?

1481
01:00:11,801 --> 01:00:12,801
Hannon: Gonna do it.

1482
01:00:12,801 --> 01:00:14,033
Lars Rasmussen:
How brave it that?

1483
01:00:14,033 --> 01:00:17,133
Hannon: [laughs]
I'm not afraid.

1484
01:00:17,133 --> 01:00:21,667
So try again.

1485
01:00:21,667 --> 01:00:24,801
I'm going to log in.

1486
01:00:24,801 --> 01:00:28,200
And then I'm going to type
Google Wave.

1487
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:31,267
So we did this yesterday
and there are only two tweets.

1488
01:00:31,267 --> 01:00:33,300
One of them was a woman
interviewing at a company

1489
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:36,801
called Wave so she said,
"I should google Wave

1490
01:00:36,801 --> 01:00:39,200
before my interview."

1491
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:42,400
So now let's sign in.
See what happens.

1492
01:00:46,701 --> 01:00:49,234
Lars Rasmussen: * Doo doo *
Hannon: A lot more than two.

1493
01:00:49,234 --> 01:00:51,901
Lars Rasmussen:
Oh! [laughs]

1494
01:00:51,901 --> 01:00:53,334
Hannon: And we can go down
to the bottom

1495
01:00:53,334 --> 01:00:54,801
and see tweets
still coming in.

1496
01:00:54,801 --> 01:00:57,234
Lars Rasmussen: Oh, my God,
you guys, thank you.

1497
01:00:57,234 --> 01:00:59,567
[laughs]
Wow. Thank you.

1498
01:00:59,567 --> 01:01:02,734
[applause]

1499
01:01:07,133 --> 01:01:09,901
Hannon: So that was a example
of an integration

1500
01:01:09,901 --> 01:01:12,934
between Wave and another
communication system.

1501
01:01:12,934 --> 01:01:15,000
Lars Rasmussen: I'll just add
to the search functionality

1502
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,901
here, actually, that you can--
you can have Tweety

1503
01:01:17,901 --> 01:01:19,701
continuously search
over in Twitter

1504
01:01:19,701 --> 01:01:21,467
and update the wave
as they come.

1505
01:01:21,467 --> 01:01:23,567
So you can use them
like "twit alerts"

1506
01:01:23,567 --> 01:01:24,901
for whatever
you're interested in.

1507
01:01:24,901 --> 01:01:27,234
It'll just pop
into your inbox.

1508
01:01:31,334 --> 01:01:33,133
Buggy.
Hannon: Buggy.

1509
01:01:33,133 --> 01:01:34,200
We were reading the tweets.

1510
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:35,534
Lars Rasmussen: We were reading
the tw--

1511
01:01:35,534 --> 01:01:36,567
Hannon:
Totally threw us off.

1512
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:38,601
[laughs]

1513
01:01:38,601 --> 01:01:40,667
Lars Rasmussen:
Okay, the last example

1514
01:01:40,667 --> 01:01:42,767
of a robot extension
we want to show

1515
01:01:42,767 --> 01:01:45,634
is an example of how you can use
Wave extension APIs

1516
01:01:45,634 --> 01:01:49,000
to integrate Wave
within existent workflows.

1517
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,534
You guys are programmers
like us.

1518
01:01:50,534 --> 01:01:53,367
You probably deal
with filing bugs.

1519
01:01:53,367 --> 01:01:54,834
I want to show you
an integration

1520
01:01:54,834 --> 01:01:57,734
between Wave
and the issue tracker--

1521
01:01:57,734 --> 01:02:00,667
the bugs database
over on code.google.com.

1522
01:02:00,667 --> 01:02:03,934
But this could be any issue
tracker Bugzilla could host,

1523
01:02:03,934 --> 01:02:05,667
whichever is your favorite.

1524
01:02:05,667 --> 01:02:08,834
So I'll just conjure up
a canned message here.

1525
01:02:08,834 --> 01:02:09,901
And I'll tell you
a little bit

1526
01:02:09,901 --> 01:02:12,067
about how we do bugs
on my team.

1527
01:02:12,067 --> 01:02:13,534
So a programmer
has built some code.

1528
01:02:13,534 --> 01:02:14,834
They send it
for code review.

1529
01:02:14,834 --> 01:02:17,667
They also send a demo
to the PMs and the UI people

1530
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:19,000
and Jens and I.

1531
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,767
And then we sit in the room
and we test it.

1532
01:02:20,767 --> 01:02:22,367
And you can't read
the text here.

1533
01:02:22,367 --> 01:02:23,701
But there's a bunch
of bullet points

1534
01:02:23,701 --> 01:02:25,367
with observations we made.

1535
01:02:25,367 --> 01:02:27,868
We, of course, edited this
collaboratively.

1536
01:02:27,868 --> 01:02:29,200
Some of them are bugs.

1537
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,400
Some of them are observations
for discussion later.

1538
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,267
Some of them are notes
for the UI designers.

1539
01:02:33,267 --> 01:02:36,434
And, of course, we should now go
and file bugs.

1540
01:02:36,434 --> 01:02:38,567
Um, but instead of doing that
manually,

1541
01:02:38,567 --> 01:02:42,234
we run an extension that lets me
just select a bullet point,

1542
01:02:42,234 --> 01:02:43,767
click this button here,

1543
01:02:43,767 --> 01:02:47,300
and now a robot enters the fray
called Buggy,

1544
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:50,868
takes that text,
and files it as a bug for me.

1545
01:02:50,868 --> 01:02:52,067
[applause]
Thank you.

1546
01:02:52,067 --> 01:02:54,601
Hannon: Hey, Lars,
why don't you add me?

1547
01:02:54,601 --> 01:02:56,100
Lars Rasmussen:
Yes. Excellent.

1548
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:57,767
And I'll add Steph
to the wave.

1549
01:02:57,767 --> 01:03:00,200
The bug--the, uh--the--the--
sorry, the robot

1550
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:03,534
also grabs a little summary
from issue tracker

1551
01:03:03,534 --> 01:03:05,567
and puts it
right inside the wave.

1552
01:03:05,567 --> 01:03:06,901
There's a link there
to the bug

1553
01:03:06,901 --> 01:03:09,267
will Stephani--which Stephanie
will now click

1554
01:03:09,267 --> 01:03:13,567
so that you can see the bug
sitting over on issue tracker.

1555
01:03:15,667 --> 01:03:17,334
Hannon: All right,
so I'm going to open this bug,

1556
01:03:17,334 --> 01:03:19,267
number 11.

1557
01:03:19,267 --> 01:03:20,634
Lars Rasmussen:
And while she does that,

1558
01:03:20,634 --> 01:03:21,968
I'll file a bunch more.

1559
01:03:21,968 --> 01:03:23,334
You can see how easy
it is.

1560
01:03:23,334 --> 01:03:26,767
And I just triple click here.
There's another one.

1561
01:03:26,767 --> 01:03:28,934
And I'll file that bug too.

1562
01:03:28,934 --> 01:03:30,701
Okay. And so now,
we might send this wave--

1563
01:03:30,701 --> 01:03:33,667
we might share this wave
with our bug triage team.

1564
01:03:33,667 --> 01:03:35,367
I'll just do that myself.

1565
01:03:35,367 --> 01:03:38,133
All I have to do
is change the assignee here.

1566
01:03:38,133 --> 01:03:41,934
I'll give this to Stephanie.
I'll take this myself.

1567
01:03:41,934 --> 01:03:44,100
And then this one
goes to Lars.

1568
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:45,300
Ooh, I'm sorry.
Was that Greg?

1569
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:46,667
Like this.

1570
01:03:46,667 --> 01:03:48,968
And now you'll see--
Stephanie will refresh the bug

1571
01:03:48,968 --> 01:03:52,300
and you'll see the robot
change the assignee over

1572
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:53,701
in the issue tracker.

1573
01:03:53,701 --> 01:03:56,200
Hannon: On the left-hand panel
where it says "owner."

1574
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:57,801
Lars Rasmussen: And also,
most issue trackers

1575
01:03:57,801 --> 01:04:00,067
or bug databases
lets you debate bugs--

1576
01:04:00,067 --> 01:04:03,400
endlessly if I recall--
inside the database.

1577
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:04,667
Which is normally
not the strength

1578
01:04:04,667 --> 01:04:05,667
of the database.

1579
01:04:05,667 --> 01:04:07,267
But it is the strength
of Wave.

1580
01:04:07,267 --> 01:04:10,200
And so instead of debating them
over on issue tracker,

1581
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:13,100
you can debate the bug
from inside Wave.

1582
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:15,667
I'll just use the inline
reply tool here.

1583
01:04:15,667 --> 01:04:16,667
And I'll say,

1584
01:04:16,667 --> 01:04:21,834
"That is so not my fault!"

1585
01:04:21,834 --> 01:04:25,234
Hannon: And I'll refresh.
You can see the update there.

1586
01:04:25,234 --> 01:04:30,534
[applause]

1587
01:04:30,534 --> 01:04:31,968
Lars Rasmussen: And so now
we can continue

1588
01:04:31,968 --> 01:04:33,801
the endless debate
inside of Wave,

1589
01:04:33,801 --> 01:04:35,133
which would be
much more efficient.

1590
01:04:35,133 --> 01:04:36,367
We could also build--

1591
01:04:36,367 --> 01:04:38,234
We haven't done this
in the sample here--

1592
01:04:38,234 --> 01:04:40,234
that if someone wanted
to go make a comment

1593
01:04:40,234 --> 01:04:41,501
over on issue tracker,

1594
01:04:41,501 --> 01:04:45,100
the robot would see that
and update the wave as well.

1595
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:47,334
And just like we did a search
through Twitter

1596
01:04:47,334 --> 01:04:49,100
into a-a wave,

1597
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:51,767
we could also have the robot
start a new wave of bugs

1598
01:04:51,767 --> 01:04:53,667
and just pull in all of the bugs
assigned to you

1599
01:04:53,667 --> 01:04:56,434
so that you could track them
from within a wave.

1600
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:59,801
It's remarkable--thank you--
how much more effective

1601
01:04:59,801 --> 01:05:02,667
this sort of thing
makes you.

1602
01:05:02,667 --> 01:05:04,767
Okay.
That's extensions for you.

1603
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,033
You guys feeling--

1604
01:05:06,033 --> 01:05:07,767
Hannon: And I think that's
two of our Ps.

1605
01:05:07,767 --> 01:05:08,901
Lars Rasmussen:
Those are two Ps.

1606
01:05:08,901 --> 01:05:10,701
Are you guys
feeling inspired yet?

1607
01:05:10,701 --> 01:05:13,501
Good. Yeah. Thank you.
[applause]

1608
01:05:13,501 --> 01:05:17,334
Thank you.

1609
01:05:17,334 --> 01:05:19,667
Okay, let's talk a little bit
about the protocols

1610
01:05:19,667 --> 01:05:22,734
and algorithms,
um, underlying Wave.

1611
01:05:22,734 --> 01:05:24,834
So we want Wave, as Stephanie
said in the beginning,

1612
01:05:24,834 --> 01:05:26,234
to be an open system.

1613
01:05:26,234 --> 01:05:28,334
Obviously,
it's an enormous reason

1614
01:05:28,334 --> 01:05:31,334
behind the success of email
that it's an open protocol.

1615
01:05:31,334 --> 01:05:33,467
Anyone can build
an email system.

1616
01:05:33,467 --> 01:05:34,901
Anyone can email
with each other

1617
01:05:34,901 --> 01:05:37,367
regardless of where they got
their accounts from.

1618
01:05:37,367 --> 01:05:41,634
We want Wave
to work the same way.

1619
01:05:41,634 --> 01:05:44,100
And so we've designed
the algorithms--

1620
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:47,767
we've designed the protocol
to, um, uh, to support

1621
01:05:47,767 --> 01:05:49,000
what we call "federation."

1622
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,968
Which means
that any organization

1623
01:05:50,968 --> 01:05:53,367
could build their own
Wave system,

1624
01:05:53,367 --> 01:05:56,434
give accounts to their users
even in competition with Google,

1625
01:05:56,434 --> 01:05:58,200
and then the system
will still ensure

1626
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,767
that we can share waves
with each other

1627
01:06:00,767 --> 01:06:02,701
across these boundaries.

1628
01:06:02,701 --> 01:06:05,033
And we want to--
we want to first show you

1629
01:06:05,033 --> 01:06:06,701
how that's going to look.

1630
01:06:06,701 --> 01:06:07,868
And then we'll talk
a little bit

1631
01:06:07,868 --> 01:06:10,400
about how far along
we are with that.

1632
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:13,567
So let me--so this is very much
work in progress.

1633
01:06:13,567 --> 01:06:16,033
Everything we've shown you
is work in progress.

1634
01:06:16,033 --> 01:06:19,400
I'm going to sign in
to, um, a different version

1635
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:23,667
of the system that sits
inside our corporate network

1636
01:06:23,667 --> 01:06:26,934
that has an open port on it
for this sort of federation.

1637
01:06:26,934 --> 01:06:30,534
And we're going to imagine
two separate wave systems.

1638
01:06:30,534 --> 01:06:31,968
One is the one
Google has built

1639
01:06:31,968 --> 01:06:34,000
that you've been looking at
all morning.

1640
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,167
The other one
is from Acme Wave,

1641
01:06:37,167 --> 01:06:39,200
which you'll see
over on Stephanie's screen.

1642
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,701
They have built
a separate system.

1643
01:06:40,701 --> 01:06:42,100
They're actually
giving out accounts

1644
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:43,868
in competition with Google.

1645
01:06:43,868 --> 01:06:47,133
You'll realize that their client
looks very similar to ours.

1646
01:06:47,133 --> 01:06:49,434
That's because we're intending
to open source

1647
01:06:49,434 --> 01:06:53,934
the lion's share of the code
that we used to build our system

1648
01:06:53,934 --> 01:06:56,834
so that organizations
can get started quickly.

1649
01:06:56,834 --> 01:06:59,133
And that's how Acme Wave
built their system.

1650
01:06:59,133 --> 01:07:03,067
So I'll start a wave
over on my account here.

1651
01:07:03,067 --> 01:07:05,701
And I will say "Project.

1652
01:07:05,701 --> 01:07:11,200
You want to work with me
on that thing?"

1653
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:13,767
And then I will add--
what's your account

1654
01:07:13,767 --> 01:07:15,067
over on Acme Wave?

1655
01:07:15,067 --> 01:07:18,334
Hannon: It's Stephanie.
Lars Rasmussen: Stephanie.

1656
01:07:18,334 --> 01:07:19,734
Stephanie on Acme Wave.

1657
01:07:19,734 --> 01:07:21,367
So Stephanie momentarily
has her account--

1658
01:07:21,367 --> 01:07:23,467
Hannon: Actually, it's Steph.
Lars Rasmussen: There we go.

1659
01:07:23,467 --> 01:07:24,467
Hannon: Sorry.

1660
01:07:24,467 --> 01:07:25,801
Lars Rasmussen:
Stephanie is now a user

1661
01:07:25,801 --> 01:07:26,868
over on Acme Wave.

1662
01:07:26,868 --> 01:07:30,100
And I'm going to add her
to the wave.

1663
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:32,100
Hannon: So I'm going
to open up the wave.

1664
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:34,300
And he says, "You want to work
with me on that thing?"

1665
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:40,100
And I said, "I think the guys
over at Initech can help too."

1666
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:43,634
Lars Rasmussen: [laughs]
And so...

1667
01:07:43,634 --> 01:07:45,601
And so even though Steph and I
have accounts

1668
01:07:45,601 --> 01:07:46,834
on different wave systems,

1669
01:07:46,834 --> 01:07:48,801
you still get that live

1670
01:07:48,801 --> 01:07:50,801
character by character
interaction.

1671
01:07:50,801 --> 01:07:52,868
The way it works is that
from our two clients,

1672
01:07:52,868 --> 01:07:54,501
these fine-grained
operations

1673
01:07:54,501 --> 01:07:56,868
travel to our respective
servers,

1674
01:07:56,868 --> 01:08:00,133
then it crosses over
and goes back up to our client.

1675
01:08:00,133 --> 01:08:02,400
And all of the liveness
and concurrency control

1676
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,467
and live--um, sorry,
and real-time resolution

1677
01:08:05,467 --> 01:08:07,400
of conflicts happen
in an algorithm

1678
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:09,701
that supports this sort
of federation.

1679
01:08:09,701 --> 01:08:12,901
Let's bring a third wave system
into the system.

1680
01:08:12,901 --> 01:08:15,033
So we have a couple of friends,
Peter and Milton,

1681
01:08:15,033 --> 01:08:17,067
that work for a company
called Initech.

1682
01:08:17,067 --> 01:08:19,567
They have chosen to run
their own wave server

1683
01:08:19,567 --> 01:08:21,400
in their server closet.

1684
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:23,000
These guys didn't take
our code.

1685
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,667
Milton is the kind of engineer
who prefers building stuff

1686
01:08:26,667 --> 01:08:29,334
from scratch.

1687
01:08:29,334 --> 01:08:31,667
Hannon: I'm not sure
I want to show this, Lars.

1688
01:08:31,667 --> 01:08:33,734
Lars Rasmussen: Oh, come on.
You show it.

1689
01:08:33,734 --> 01:08:35,801
I'm going to add Peter
and I'm going to add Milton.

1690
01:08:35,801 --> 01:08:37,200
Why don't you want me
to show it?

1691
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,367
Hannon: I'm afraid this crowd
might like their UI

1692
01:08:39,367 --> 01:08:41,934
better than ours
and it would break my heart.

1693
01:08:41,934 --> 01:08:44,701
Lars Rasmussen:
Don't break her heart.

1694
01:08:44,701 --> 01:08:48,634
[cheers and applause]

1695
01:08:51,334 --> 01:08:56,467
Do you have the wave?
Do you have the wave?

1696
01:08:56,467 --> 01:08:58,133
Hannon: No, 'cause--
Lars Rasmussen: Hmm?

1697
01:08:58,133 --> 01:09:01,534
Hannon: Just make
another edit.

1698
01:09:01,534 --> 01:09:03,868
So now I have the wave.

1699
01:09:03,868 --> 01:09:08,701
Lars Rasmussen: So she opens--
Hannon: And if I go into it...

1700
01:09:08,701 --> 01:09:12,567
[cheers and applause]

1701
01:09:12,567 --> 01:09:15,801
Lars Rasmussen: Thank you.

1702
01:09:15,801 --> 01:09:17,901
Hannon: Now I want to show you
an important principle

1703
01:09:17,901 --> 01:09:21,267
of--an important feature
of the protocol.

1704
01:09:21,267 --> 01:09:23,000
So I go back to Acme Wave

1705
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,734
and I'm going to make
a private reply

1706
01:09:24,734 --> 01:09:26,834
just like you saw earlier
in the demo.

1707
01:09:26,834 --> 01:09:29,634
But I'm going to add everyone
except Lars.

1708
01:09:29,634 --> 01:09:35,300
So I'll say, "What do you think
of that Google guy?"

1709
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:40,434
So I'll add all of my friends
Peter and Milton.

1710
01:09:40,434 --> 01:09:43,467
Even though this wave
is owned at Google

1711
01:09:43,467 --> 01:09:46,901
and there's copies on Acme Wave
and Initech servers,

1712
01:09:46,901 --> 01:09:50,567
this private reply
is never seen by Google

1713
01:09:50,567 --> 01:09:53,734
and cannot be discovered
by Lars in any way.

1714
01:09:53,734 --> 01:09:56,467
In fact, if Peter and Milton
made a private reply

1715
01:09:56,467 --> 01:09:58,300
between themselves,

1716
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:01,634
that wave would never leave
their server closet.

1717
01:10:01,634 --> 01:10:06,701
[applause]

1718
01:10:06,701 --> 01:10:07,968
Lars Rasmussen: Thank you.

1719
01:10:07,968 --> 01:10:09,567
Hannon: And I just want
to go back over to Milton

1720
01:10:09,567 --> 01:10:10,901
for a second.

1721
01:10:10,901 --> 01:10:13,400
You can see the private reply
came in there as well.

1722
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:15,434
Lars Rasmussen: Okay,
so let me just say this,

1723
01:10:15,434 --> 01:10:17,901
um, federation...

1724
01:10:17,901 --> 01:10:19,000
that was hard.

1725
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,334
So we're building this thing

1726
01:10:20,334 --> 01:10:22,100
with live concurrent editing,
and chatting,

1727
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:23,834
and instant messaging,
and email, and pictures,

1728
01:10:23,834 --> 01:10:25,000
and all that stuff.

1729
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,300
And then we throw federation
into the mix,

1730
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:30,067
which vastly
complicates things.

1731
01:10:30,067 --> 01:10:31,667
It would be so much easier,
frankly,

1732
01:10:31,667 --> 01:10:33,000
from an engineering
point of view.

1733
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,033
If we could just keep this
proprietary,

1734
01:10:35,033 --> 01:10:36,467
then we'd control
all the servers,

1735
01:10:36,467 --> 01:10:38,133
we'd control
all the update schedules,

1736
01:10:38,133 --> 01:10:39,534
and so on.

1737
01:10:39,534 --> 01:10:42,267
But we think it's worth
the effort--

1738
01:10:42,267 --> 01:10:44,467
and we hope you guys
will help us with this.

1739
01:10:44,467 --> 01:10:46,200
We think the world
will be a much better place

1740
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:48,734
if this is an open system
that everyone can build

1741
01:10:48,734 --> 01:10:50,534
wave services with it.

1742
01:10:50,534 --> 01:10:52,033
And so--thank you.

1743
01:10:52,033 --> 01:10:53,834
[applause]

1744
01:10:53,834 --> 01:10:55,901
Thank you.

1745
01:10:55,901 --> 01:10:59,567
[applause]

1746
01:10:59,567 --> 01:11:01,934
And so let me tell you,
um, where we're at with it.

1747
01:11:01,934 --> 01:11:03,868
So later today,
there's a web site--

1748
01:11:03,868 --> 01:11:06,467
I'll show you the URL later--
that's going to launch,

1749
01:11:06,467 --> 01:11:08,934
which will have--
it's a very early draft

1750
01:11:08,934 --> 01:11:10,133
of this protocol.

1751
01:11:10,133 --> 01:11:12,267
It'll have, I think,
four whitepapers

1752
01:11:12,267 --> 01:11:15,167
describing
how the system works.

1753
01:11:15,167 --> 01:11:16,334
It's going to have,
of course,

1754
01:11:16,334 --> 01:11:17,767
a public discussion forum

1755
01:11:17,767 --> 01:11:21,100
so that we can start debating
how this hopefully bright future

1756
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:23,300
of Wave will look.

1757
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:25,467
And then
like I said, later,

1758
01:11:25,467 --> 01:11:28,567
we're going to open source
the lion's share of our code,

1759
01:11:28,567 --> 01:11:31,467
which will serve both as
a reference implementation

1760
01:11:31,467 --> 01:11:32,701
of the protocol,

1761
01:11:32,701 --> 01:11:34,701
but also essentially
a production ready system

1762
01:11:34,701 --> 01:11:36,601
like you saw Acme Wave do.

1763
01:11:36,601 --> 01:11:38,767
I'm obviously vastly
simplifying it here.

1764
01:11:38,767 --> 01:11:41,000
But essentially,
you could take that code,

1765
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,868
you could put it on top
of your own database,

1766
01:11:42,868 --> 01:11:44,968
and you would have
a simple wave server

1767
01:11:44,968 --> 01:11:47,501
and you would be up
and running.

1768
01:11:47,501 --> 01:11:50,300
Okay.
So that's federation.

1769
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,234
[laughs]

1770
01:11:54,234 --> 01:11:55,667
Hannon: I'm excited
about our next demo.

1771
01:11:55,667 --> 01:11:58,133
Lars Rasmussen: The next demo
is very, very nice.

1772
01:11:58,133 --> 01:12:02,534
This is something, um,
to end off our demo with.

1773
01:12:02,534 --> 01:12:04,501
It's something,
uh, a friend of ours

1774
01:12:04,501 --> 01:12:06,767
on the Google research team
has been building

1775
01:12:06,767 --> 01:12:08,133
over the past month.

1776
01:12:08,133 --> 01:12:11,334
I saw it myself the first time
just a few days ago.

1777
01:12:11,334 --> 01:12:12,801
Um, and it blew me away.

1778
01:12:12,801 --> 01:12:14,567
So, um, let's see.

1779
01:12:14,567 --> 01:12:16,901
I'm going to make sure
I'm on the right system here.

1780
01:12:16,901 --> 01:12:18,167
I'm back on the sandbox.

1781
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:19,634
So again, we've been doing
this demo

1782
01:12:19,634 --> 01:12:22,734
on a system where we'll get
you guys accounts.

1783
01:12:22,734 --> 01:12:26,267
Now, Stephanie is going
to log into, um, an account

1784
01:12:26,267 --> 01:12:28,934
of one of our colleagues,
Alexi.

1785
01:12:28,934 --> 01:12:30,200
And then I'm going to start
a new wave.

1786
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:31,868
I want to make sure
you guys can see

1787
01:12:31,868 --> 01:12:33,868
what we're typing.

1788
01:12:33,868 --> 01:12:36,868
I'm making this
a little bigger like this.

1789
01:12:36,868 --> 01:12:38,834
Do you make your font
bigger there, Steph?

1790
01:12:38,834 --> 01:12:40,000
Hannon: Yeah,
I was going to wait

1791
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,501
till you started
the wave.

1792
01:12:42,501 --> 01:12:44,267
Lars Rasmussen: And then
I'll start a new wave here.

1793
01:12:44,267 --> 01:12:47,901
And I'll add Alexi,
one of our colleagues.

1794
01:12:47,901 --> 01:12:51,400
And then I'll add
my all-time favorite robot

1795
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:54,667
called Rosy.

1796
01:12:54,667 --> 01:12:55,734
Yes.

1797
01:12:55,734 --> 01:12:58,434
So, um,
Alexi is from France.

1798
01:12:58,434 --> 01:13:01,334
His English
is not terribly good.

1799
01:13:01,334 --> 01:13:03,801
Hannon: Aww!

1800
01:13:03,801 --> 01:13:05,767
Lars Rasmussen: For the purposes
of this demo.

1801
01:13:05,767 --> 01:13:07,868
[laughter]

1802
01:13:07,868 --> 01:13:11,000
And Rosy is a robot
that very kindly translates

1803
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,501
what I'm typing.

1804
01:13:13,501 --> 01:13:16,834
"Hello, world!"

1805
01:13:16,834 --> 01:13:18,501
[applause]

1806
01:13:18,501 --> 01:13:20,901
"What do you think

1807
01:13:20,901 --> 01:13:24,767
"of this demo--

1808
01:13:24,767 --> 01:13:27,434
of this demo?"

1809
01:13:32,567 --> 01:13:34,467
And now Alexi's typing
in France.

1810
01:13:34,467 --> 01:13:37,801
And I get to see him saying,
"Ah, yes...

1811
01:13:37,801 --> 01:13:41,100
since new--we are in
can--use--used--"

1812
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:43,634
Translates word by word,
character by character

1813
01:13:43,634 --> 01:13:45,400
as he's typing.

1814
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:47,834
Rosy speaks, I believe,
40 languages.

1815
01:13:47,834 --> 01:13:50,667
She can translate
between any pair of them.

1816
01:13:50,667 --> 01:13:54,901
Um, she's quite the thing.

1817
01:13:54,901 --> 01:13:57,634
Okay.
That finishes our demo.

1818
01:13:57,634 --> 01:13:58,901
Oh, thank you.

1819
01:13:58,901 --> 01:14:03,968
[cheers and applause]
Thank you. Thank you.

1820
01:14:03,968 --> 01:14:09,467
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

1821
01:14:09,467 --> 01:14:11,667
Thank you.

1822
01:14:13,567 --> 01:14:15,634
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

1823
01:14:15,634 --> 01:14:18,934
[cheers and applause]
Thank you. Thank you.

1824
01:14:18,934 --> 01:14:22,701
Hannon: I think they like it.
Lars Rasmussen: They like it.

1825
01:14:22,701 --> 01:14:27,367
You guys like it? Okay.
Thank you.

1826
01:14:27,367 --> 01:14:31,968
Hannon: Thank you.
Wow. Thank you. [laughs]

1827
01:14:31,968 --> 01:14:36,601
[cheers and applause]
Lars Rasmussen: Thank you.

1828
01:14:36,601 --> 01:14:39,801
Thank you.
[whistling and cheers]

1829
01:14:39,801 --> 01:14:41,968
Hannon: They have a lot
of skills.

1830
01:14:41,968 --> 01:14:46,234
[applause]

1831
01:14:46,234 --> 01:14:47,901
I think...
Lars Rasmussen: Thank you.

1832
01:14:47,901 --> 01:14:51,234
Hannon: If they really
liked it...

1833
01:14:51,234 --> 01:14:52,400
[man shouting indistinctly]

1834
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:54,701
If you guys--you guys
really liked it,

1835
01:14:54,701 --> 01:14:56,200
you could do a wave.

1836
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:58,100
Lars Rasmussen: So, so, so--
Hannon: Anyone?

1837
01:14:58,100 --> 01:15:00,000
It's time to do the wave.
Lars Rasmussen: So--

1838
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,234
So, um,
what do you guys think?

1839
01:15:03,234 --> 01:15:05,934
Okay. [laughs]

1840
01:15:05,934 --> 01:15:07,534
So just--
Hannon: Thank you for filming.

1841
01:15:07,534 --> 01:15:08,801
Lars Rasmussen:
Just to summarize,

1842
01:15:08,801 --> 01:15:11,033
um, what we like to think
we've built here 

1843
01:15:11,033 --> 01:15:13,667
is really quite a simple
communication object

1844
01:15:13,667 --> 01:15:15,033
called a wave.

1845
01:15:15,033 --> 01:15:16,834
And we've showed
how you can use it

1846
01:15:16,834 --> 01:15:18,501
for quite a lot
of different types

1847
01:15:18,501 --> 01:15:20,901
of communication
and collaboration.

1848
01:15:20,901 --> 01:15:23,767
We showed you how plain vanilla
email-type conversations

1849
01:15:23,767 --> 01:15:25,000
could be done.

1850
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,067
We showed you how instant
messaging conversations

1851
01:15:27,067 --> 01:15:28,200
could be done.

1852
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:29,901
We showed you how easy it is
to share photos

1853
01:15:29,901 --> 01:15:31,834
and other rich media types
with it.

1854
01:15:31,834 --> 01:15:34,067
We introduced a platform
that we're hoping you guys

1855
01:15:34,067 --> 01:15:35,367
will pick up

1856
01:15:35,367 --> 01:15:37,300
that will let you build things
like blogging sites,

1857
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:40,033
discussion groups,
uh, letting your users

1858
01:15:40,033 --> 01:15:42,400
discuss images
on your web site.

1859
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:43,734
With the editing
functionality,

1860
01:15:43,734 --> 01:15:45,400
you can see you can build
Wiki-like sites

1861
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:46,534
with that as well.

1862
01:15:46,534 --> 01:15:48,033
We showed you
how you can use waves

1863
01:15:48,033 --> 01:15:50,534
to collaboratively
edit documents.

1864
01:15:50,534 --> 01:15:53,801
We showed you a rich set
of extension APIs

1865
01:15:53,801 --> 01:15:56,467
that could let you build
everything from games,

1866
01:15:56,467 --> 01:15:59,734
through collaborative
applications inside a wave,

1867
01:15:59,734 --> 01:16:02,534
through integrations with other
communication systems.

1868
01:16:02,534 --> 01:16:03,801
We showed you Twitter.

1869
01:16:03,801 --> 01:16:05,400
We're hoping you guys
will build gateways

1870
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:08,133
from Wave to email,
to Facebook,

1871
01:16:08,133 --> 01:16:10,567
to instant messaging,
and so on.

1872
01:16:10,567 --> 01:16:14,033
We showed you how you can use
these extension APIs

1873
01:16:14,033 --> 01:16:18,734
to also integrate waves
into work flows.

1874
01:16:18,734 --> 01:16:22,934
Whew. Okay.

1875
01:16:22,934 --> 01:16:24,033
And now...

1876
01:16:24,033 --> 01:16:25,133
Hannon:
Just going to bring up...

1877
01:16:25,133 --> 01:16:27,467
Lars Rasmussen:
For the administrativia

1878
01:16:27,467 --> 01:16:28,601
at the end,

1879
01:16:28,601 --> 01:16:32,634
I want to--
I want to just point out--

1880
01:16:32,634 --> 01:16:33,701
I forgot that earlier

1881
01:16:33,701 --> 01:16:35,467
that we have three
breakout sessions

1882
01:16:35,467 --> 01:16:39,868
that I don't believe has been
in the program so far.

1883
01:16:39,868 --> 01:16:44,534
Um, the first one at noon
is about, um, the API.

1884
01:16:44,534 --> 01:16:46,968
If you can only come to one
of our breakout sessions,

1885
01:16:46,968 --> 01:16:49,367
please make it that one.

1886
01:16:49,367 --> 01:16:50,968
The next one is a little
run-through

1887
01:16:50,968 --> 01:16:52,801
of some of the more
exciting pieces of technology

1888
01:16:52,801 --> 01:16:54,033
under the hood.

1889
01:16:54,033 --> 01:16:56,000
We're going to show you
from the top of the--

1890
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,634
top of the stack how our amazing
spell-checker works,

1891
01:16:59,634 --> 01:17:03,100
how the rich text editor
in the browser works,

1892
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:04,934
and the algorithms
that we used underneath

1893
01:17:04,934 --> 01:17:06,767
to do all
the concurrency, control,

1894
01:17:06,767 --> 01:17:09,367
and conflict resolution
and so on.

1895
01:17:09,367 --> 01:17:10,767
And then at 2:30,

1896
01:17:10,767 --> 01:17:13,234
one of our client team
tech leads

1897
01:17:13,234 --> 01:17:16,567
are going to explain
how we build

1898
01:17:16,567 --> 01:17:19,734
the web application
with the Google Web Toolkit,

1899
01:17:19,734 --> 01:17:21,434
why we love it so much,

1900
01:17:21,434 --> 01:17:24,934
and what some other
future plans are.

1901
01:17:24,934 --> 01:17:26,634
We also have in Room B4

1902
01:17:26,634 --> 01:17:28,734
from noon till 4:30
office hours

1903
01:17:28,734 --> 01:17:32,300
where you guys can come talk
to the team in blue here.

1904
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:36,467
They love talking.

1905
01:17:36,467 --> 01:17:39,133
And then I wanted
to show you,

1906
01:17:39,133 --> 01:17:42,634
um, three important
URLs here.

1907
01:17:42,634 --> 01:17:44,934
So for starters,
wave.google.com

1908
01:17:44,934 --> 01:17:47,534
is going to be the home
of Google Wave

1909
01:17:47,534 --> 01:17:49,801
when we launch it
later in the year.

1910
01:17:49,801 --> 01:17:52,133
If you go there now
or when the site goes live

1911
01:17:52,133 --> 01:17:53,300
in a little bit,

1912
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:55,033
um, there is
a sign-up form there

1913
01:17:55,033 --> 01:17:56,534
where you can sign up
for notifications

1914
01:17:56,534 --> 01:17:57,834
when we launch it.

1915
01:17:57,834 --> 01:18:01,234
There's also going to be
a beautifully edited video

1916
01:18:01,234 --> 01:18:03,367
of today's keynote.

1917
01:18:03,367 --> 01:18:06,367
Um, the API site
is going to go live...

1918
01:18:06,367 --> 01:18:07,601
man: Already live.

1919
01:18:07,601 --> 01:18:09,300
Lars Rasmussen: The API site
is already live.

1920
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:11,801
No wonder I couldn't--
couldn't get a connection

1921
01:18:11,801 --> 01:18:13,734
to my mobile phone before.

1922
01:18:13,734 --> 01:18:18,767
It's at
code.google.com/apis/wave.

1923
01:18:18,767 --> 01:18:21,133
It's got the API.
It's got the documentation.

1924
01:18:21,133 --> 01:18:23,567
It's got the code samples
we showed before.

1925
01:18:23,567 --> 01:18:25,934
Actually, I should just mention
really quickly

1926
01:18:25,934 --> 01:18:28,801
the bug--the--the issue
tracker integration

1927
01:18:28,801 --> 01:18:30,100
we showed at the end,

1928
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:31,868
we have to cheat
ever slow slightly

1929
01:18:31,868 --> 01:18:35,267
by using, uh, using
an internal API

1930
01:18:35,267 --> 01:18:36,334
to the issue tracker.

1931
01:18:36,334 --> 01:18:37,667
I think they're working
really hard

1932
01:18:37,667 --> 01:18:39,167
making APIs available.

1933
01:18:39,167 --> 01:18:41,467
So that particular sample
is not going to be there

1934
01:18:41,467 --> 01:18:43,400
for--for a wee while.

1935
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:46,033
Lastly,
at waveprotocol.org,

1936
01:18:46,033 --> 01:18:48,434
you'll find
the protocol draft,

1937
01:18:48,434 --> 01:18:50,467
the whitepapers,
the discussion forum,

1938
01:18:50,467 --> 01:18:52,868
and so on if you guys
are interested

1939
01:18:52,868 --> 01:18:55,868
in helping us,
um, build that wave

1940
01:18:55,868 --> 01:18:57,701
to be an open system.

1941
01:18:57,701 --> 01:18:59,634
Hannon: You should tell them
about the email.

1942
01:18:59,634 --> 01:19:00,801
Lars Rasmussen: Yes.

1943
01:19:00,801 --> 01:19:02,367
And the way you're going
to get an account

1944
01:19:02,367 --> 01:19:04,100
is you'll receive an email
later today

1945
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:07,167
that explains where you can go
and sign up

1946
01:19:07,167 --> 01:19:08,467
for an account,

1947
01:19:08,467 --> 01:19:12,200
which you will get shortly.

1948
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:14,901
Okay. So, look, the last thing
I want to say,

1949
01:19:14,901 --> 01:19:18,868
um, you can probably imagine
it felt kind of nice

1950
01:19:18,868 --> 01:19:21,133
that you guys seemed to like
what we built.

1951
01:19:21,133 --> 01:19:23,033
Um, one of the--
one of the best times

1952
01:19:23,033 --> 01:19:24,501
in my professional life

1953
01:19:24,501 --> 01:19:28,100
was after we launched
Google Maps back in 2005

1954
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:30,968
and developers started doing
all kinds of crazy things

1955
01:19:30,968 --> 01:19:32,033
with Google Maps.

1956
01:19:32,033 --> 01:19:33,701
I hope some of you
are here.

1957
01:19:33,701 --> 01:19:36,434
This was even before
we had an API on Maps.

1958
01:19:36,434 --> 01:19:38,801
We scrambled to put an API
on Maps.

1959
01:19:38,801 --> 01:19:41,734
And it's, uh, it's--
it's become very popular

1960
01:19:41,734 --> 01:19:45,033
and it's a huge driving force
of success.

1961
01:19:45,033 --> 01:19:47,000
We learned
a very important lesson

1962
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,767
that--that you guys,
developers,

1963
01:19:48,767 --> 01:19:51,334
are incredibly important
to the success

1964
01:19:51,334 --> 01:19:53,567
of the kind of products
that we build.

1965
01:19:53,567 --> 01:19:56,667
And so I can't wait
to see what you guys

1966
01:19:56,667 --> 01:19:58,167
are gonna come up with.

1967
01:19:58,167 --> 01:20:00,334
Um, please, please, please,
check it out.

1968
01:20:00,334 --> 01:20:02,400
Build cool stuff.
Surprise us.

1969
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:06,534
I just can't wait to see
what you come up with.

1970
01:20:06,534 --> 01:20:07,968
Thank you very much.

1971
01:20:07,968 --> 01:20:10,834
[cheers and applause]
