1
00:00:01,033 --> 00:00:01,968
One of the things
I really like about GWT

2
00:00:01,968 --> 00:00:04,934
is the introduction
of generics in GWT 1.5.

3
00:00:04,934 --> 00:00:06,968
This allows for better
static type checking

4
00:00:06,968 --> 00:00:08,601
in the client part
of the application,

5
00:00:08,601 --> 00:00:11,567
and as a result,
a more solid product.

6
00:00:11,567 --> 00:00:13,734
One of the things I'd like
to see in GWT moving forward

7
00:00:13,734 --> 00:00:15,534
is the ability
to edit CSS

8
00:00:15,534 --> 00:00:17,467
while in hosted mode.

9
00:00:17,467 --> 00:00:19,033
That would save
a lot of time

10
00:00:19,033 --> 00:00:20,634
from having to go
to "compile browse"

11
00:00:20,634 --> 00:00:23,534
and open a tool
such as Firefox with Firebug

12
00:00:23,534 --> 00:00:25,701
to edit CSS styles.
