00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,767
>> Sachs:
My name's Eric Sachs.

2
00:00:06,767 --> 00:00:07,868
I'm gonna be speaking

3
00:00:07,868 --> 00:00:09,701
at the Google I/O conference
this year

4
00:00:09,701 --> 00:00:11,567
about some identity standards,

5
00:00:11,567 --> 00:00:13,200
especially in the enterprise.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,734
What I'm gonna focus on

7
00:00:14,734 --> 00:00:18,000
is that Web 2.0 mashups,
as they've gotten more popular--

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
they've been fun,
but they mostly are designed

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,234
to mash up public data--

10
00:00:21,234 --> 00:00:23,767
Google Maps, government data,
et cetera.

11
00:00:23,767 --> 00:00:24,934
And in this session

12
00:00:24,934 --> 00:00:26,100
we're gonna be talking about

13
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,167
security and identity standards

14
00:00:28,167 --> 00:00:30,367
to enable secure mashups,

15
00:00:30,367 --> 00:00:32,968
especially
in some enterprise settings.

16
00:00:32,968 --> 00:00:35,400
They're a whole mix of,
you know, different standards.

17
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,434
Figuring out
what to use when is hard--

18
00:00:37,434 --> 00:00:41,434
OpenID, SAML,
OAuth, OpenSocial,

19
00:00:41,434 --> 00:00:43,467
strong auth,
portable contacts.

20
00:00:43,467 --> 00:00:45,234
More all the time.

21
00:00:45,234 --> 00:00:47,801
So in the first section
of this talk,

22
00:00:47,801 --> 00:00:50,234
we're gonna talk about
Federated Login

23
00:00:50,234 --> 00:00:52,467
and some of the standards
in that space

24
00:00:52,467 --> 00:00:55,334
such as SAML and OpenID.

25
00:00:55,334 --> 00:00:56,467
In particularly, though,

26
00:00:56,467 --> 00:00:57,701
we're gonna focus on

27
00:00:57,701 --> 00:01:00,701
how some of the Software
as a Service vendors

28
00:01:00,701 --> 00:01:02,868
are leveraging this technology

29
00:01:02,868 --> 00:01:05,767
to improve the experience
they offer enterprises,

30
00:01:05,767 --> 00:01:07,000
and in addition,

31
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,400
we're also gonna focus
on some new trends

32
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,334
to make it easier
for small and medium businesses

33
00:01:12,334 --> 00:01:15,534
to use this type of
federation login technology

34
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:17,133
that in the past was

35
00:01:17,133 --> 00:01:19,534
more really just
for the large enterprises

36
00:01:19,534 --> 00:01:22,200
who could afford
the complex deployments.

37
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,701
Then, in the second
section of this talk,

38
00:01:25,701 --> 00:01:27,501
we're gonna move on
and talk about

39
00:01:27,501 --> 00:01:30,534
how can you mash up
these applications

40
00:01:30,534 --> 00:01:33,701
running on different
Software as a Service vendors,

41
00:01:33,701 --> 00:01:35,834
or to make it even more complex,

42
00:01:35,834 --> 00:01:38,167
you know, what if there's
some code that you've written

43
00:01:38,167 --> 00:01:40,534
that's running on top
of a platform

44
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:41,734
as a service vendor,

45
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:44,300
such as Amazon Web Services,

46
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,667
Azure, Google App Engine,
et cetera?

47
00:01:47,667 --> 00:01:50,834
You may even want to combine
something running on those

48
00:01:50,834 --> 00:01:53,767
with a web service
running behind your firewall.

49
00:01:53,767 --> 00:01:57,400
So this type of cross-platform
web service integration

50
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,267
is an area where we're seeing
a lot of consternation

51
00:02:00,267 --> 00:02:02,367
and questions
about best practices.

52
00:02:02,367 --> 00:02:04,234
Again, my name's Eric Sachs.

53
00:02:04,234 --> 00:02:06,868
I'm gonna be
at Google I/O 2009 in May,

54
00:02:06,868 --> 00:02:08,400
and I look forward
to seeing you there.

55
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,567
Thanks.
