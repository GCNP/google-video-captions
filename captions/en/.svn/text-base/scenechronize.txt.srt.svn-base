Hi, I'm Rob Powers from Clever Machine.

0:00:02.360,0:00:05.219
We built our app Scenechronize using the google web toolkit.

0:00:05.460,0:00:11.199
Scenechronize is an application designed for a producing team to make a movie or television program.

0:00:11.519,0:00:12.949
Let me show you the

0:00:13.479,0:00:19.079
application. Scenechronize is an application that's based around a script for a movie or a television production. The

0:00:19.489,0:00:22.159
user would first load in a PDF of their script

0:00:22.250,0:00:23.299
and we would parse it. We

0:00:23.299,0:00:25.350
pull information about the scenes,

0:00:25.599,0:00:29.239
the locations, and the speaking characters directly out of the script.

0:00:29.529,0:00:30.139
Um,

0:00:30.139,0:00:33.589
as you can see on the display here, the script is shown on the left side and

0:00:33.869,0:00:35.579
the user can scroll through. As

0:00:35.909,0:00:37.080
they scroll, the

0:00:37.080,0:00:38.720
page updates to show

0:00:38.720,0:00:41.139
various information for the current scene. The

0:00:41.319,0:00:42.769
user can also navigate

0:00:43.029,0:00:44.969
using the pearls along the top

0:00:45.100,0:00:48.019
by just clicking and it will directly go to that scene.

0:00:48.189,0:00:52.039
Or also, using the list box along the left side.

0:00:53.170,0:00:56.079
Let's go take a look at a scene that has some information in it that

0:00:56.680,0:00:59.319
would be typical in a production that's in progress.

0:01:00.259,0:01:01.649
In this particular scene, you

0:01:01.680,0:01:04.250
can see that on the right, there are a number of

0:01:04.250,0:01:06.329
items that are described. These

0:01:06.620,0:01:07.790
are the various

0:01:07.790,0:01:11.479
pieces for that scene that are going to be needed when shooting occurs.

0:01:11.830,0:01:15.659
These would include the characters with speaking parts as well as non-speaking parts,

0:01:15.860,0:01:17.479
extras, animals,

0:01:17.690,0:01:18.919
picture vehicles,

0:01:19.040,0:01:21.299
sound effects that needs

0:01:21.769,0:01:23.919
to happen, set information,

0:01:23.940,0:01:24.709
and the like.

0:01:25.510,0:01:27.329
to add new items into the

0:01:27.970,0:01:29.250
scene, you can either

0:01:29.470,0:01:30.439
click on part

0:01:30.470,0:01:32.909
of the ui on the right, or you can tag. And

0:01:32.989,0:01:35.799
tagging is simply a selection in the script itself,

0:01:36.059,0:01:38.139
telling it what item category

0:01:38.139,0:01:39.369
you're including.

0:01:39.639,0:01:41.529
In this case, we have a camera

0:01:41.669,0:01:43.349
that's needed for scene 21 and

0:01:43.349,0:01:45.679
we already have an existing camera in the system. So

0:01:45.909,0:01:47.789
we can select the existing element and

0:01:47.790,0:01:49.969
it gets displayed right on the screen.

0:01:52.169,0:01:55.029
For more information about any of the items, you can click on them.

0:01:55.360,0:02:02.119
And that comes, it will show a list of scenes that that particular item is used in. In this case, we're looking at a character

0:02:02.250,0:02:03.969
called David from this movie.

0:02:04.369,0:02:07.449
Uh, he's used in, he appears in 73 scenes and there

0:02:07.619,0:02:10.430
were a number of actors that were considered for the

0:02:10.819,0:02:12.370
role. For the actors, you

0:02:12.549,0:02:13.499
can click

0:02:13.499,0:02:15.500
onto any of the options that were

0:02:16.039,0:02:16.790
considered

0:02:16.889,0:02:19.880
and see pictures as well as other biographical data. You

0:02:20.459,0:02:24.589
can choose the appropriate actor that's actually going to be used in the movie on this screen.

0:02:25.129,0:02:31.100
Um, you can notice that as soon as you select one, if we switch tabs, it will be reflected immediately there.

0:02:31.199,0:02:33.570
Any reporting that gets done on the project will

0:02:33.629,0:02:36.190
include the latest update as soon as you enter it.

0:02:37.439,0:02:39.279
Another use for our application is

0:02:39.279,0:02:41.080
for scheduling a production.

0:02:41.359,0:02:47.479
The tool that's used in the industry is something called a strip board, and what we have provided is an electronic version of that.

0:02:48.269,0:02:50.500
It's basically a list of scenes,

0:02:50.509,0:02:52.699
each one as a "strip" that are

0:02:52.939,0:02:54.760
broken down by shooting day. Our

0:02:55.419,0:02:57.860
application uses a drag and drop interface that

0:02:58.019,0:02:59.770
allows the user to pull,

0:02:59.799,0:03:01.750
uh, one or more

0:03:01.939,0:03:03.110
of these strips

0:03:03.209,0:03:06.070
around the stripboard as needed. As

0:03:06.349,0:03:08.369
those changes happen, things

0:03:08.599,0:03:11.550
like the number of pages that are being shot that day

0:03:11.839,0:03:13.229
updates live. The

0:03:13.829,0:03:15.909
rich interface that our app provides

0:03:15.909,0:03:19.150
allows users to work in an environment that is comfortable to them

0:03:19.219,0:03:22.540
while providing a lot of data in a small amount of screen real estate. We

0:03:23.249,0:03:27.220
chose to use GWT for our application because it allowed us to write in Java,

0:03:27.489,0:03:31.440
which opened up the wide range of tools that are available for Java-based apps.

0:03:31.739,0:03:33.520
This allowed us to maintain the app,

0:03:33.899,0:03:36.889
refactor the code, and most importantly, debug it

0:03:37.179,0:03:40.440
much more easily than if we'd been writing in Javascript directly. We

0:03:41.119,0:03:44.029
tried a few of the other Javascript libraries available, and

0:03:44.039,0:03:46.500
we found that our code was slower

0:03:46.579,0:03:48.940
and more bug-prone than when we were using GWT. One of

0:03:49.859,0:03:53.039
the other advantages of GWT is because it is

0:03:53.169,0:03:55.149
multi-browser, it supports multiple browsers,

0:03:55.299,0:03:58.919
we're able to actually write our app so that it looks the same and works the same

0:03:58.999,0:04:01.029
across four major browser types. As

0:04:01.489,0:04:03.449
far as the user is concerned,

0:04:03.679,0:04:04.930
they don't know that

0:04:04.939,0:04:06.839
there's a difference between them,

0:04:06.929,0:04:07.930
but uhm, the

0:04:08.149,0:04:11.430
code is obviously quite different because of the GWT compiler's output.

0:04:12.579,0:04:17.739
We extended the GWT widget library so that we could use a custom MVC layer that we built,

0:04:17.919,0:04:19.640
and this allowed us to minimize the

0:04:19.690,0:04:24.339
amount of data that needed to be called into the client

0:04:24.519,0:04:29.200
and simplified the client coding so that we were less prone to introducting bugs due

0:04:29.329,0:04:31.619
to custom data request, uh,

0:04:31.619,0:04:32.329
data requests

0:04:33.169,0:04:33.850
that we

0:04:34.039,0:04:35.769
would need to make.

0:04:36.649,0:04:38.010
We utilize the

0:04:38.109,0:04:41.970
plug-in architecture of the GWT RPC layer to support the back end of that.

0:04:42.099,0:04:47.559
So as a user needs data, we can pull it piecemeal, piece by piece, from the server. And

0:04:47.739,0:04:52.519
as they make changes to things, we can push the changes live back to the

0:04:52.519,0:04:54.950
server. Overall we've been very happy with our experience with GWT,

0:04:55.279,0:04:58.160
and our app has been much better as a result.
