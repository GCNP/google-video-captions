1
00:00:01,667 --> 00:00:04,634
Cutts: So if you have a site
that you want to throw up here--

2
00:00:04,634 --> 00:00:06,801
we got one on a piece of paper
just before the session--

3
00:00:06,801 --> 00:00:09,634
if you have a site, you know,
write it down, bring it on up.

4
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:10,667
We'll be looking at it

5
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:12,133
throughout the course
of this session.

6
00:00:12,133 --> 00:00:14,334
If we don't get to look
at your site,

7
00:00:14,334 --> 00:00:18,667
feel free to catch me
or Brian or Greg afterwards.

8
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:20,968
So it's a good chance
to introduce, folks,

9
00:00:20,968 --> 00:00:22,834
Greg Grothaus, Brian White.

10
00:00:22,834 --> 00:00:25,834
We're all members of Google's
search-quality team.

11
00:00:25,834 --> 00:00:29,501
So our job is to make sure
that if you type in your name,

12
00:00:29,501 --> 00:00:31,300
you don't get porn back.

13
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,300
Right?
Unless you're a porn star.

14
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,968
If you're a porn star,
then you want to get porn back.

15
00:00:35,968 --> 00:00:38,701
But if you just type in,
you know,

16
00:00:38,701 --> 00:00:40,467
"iPod car"
or something like that,

17
00:00:40,467 --> 00:00:42,033
you want to get
a really relevant result.

18
00:00:42,033 --> 00:00:44,067
So without further ado,

19
00:00:44,067 --> 00:00:45,634
we're going to start
jumping right in.

20
00:00:45,634 --> 00:00:47,667
If you have a site
you'd like to get reviewed,

21
00:00:47,667 --> 00:00:49,601
again, just write it down,
bring it up.

22
00:00:49,601 --> 00:00:51,067
Brian or Greg
will start looking at it.

23
00:00:51,067 --> 00:00:52,868
I'll start looking at it.
Yeah, bring up a business card.

24
00:00:52,868 --> 00:00:55,601
Anything like that.

25
00:00:55,601 --> 00:00:57,634
Okay, cool.

26
00:00:57,634 --> 00:00:59,067
Excellent.
All right.

27
00:00:59,067 --> 00:01:00,834
And worst case,
we'll catch you afterwards.

28
00:01:00,834 --> 00:01:03,334
Okay, so this one
was kind of interesting.

29
00:01:03,334 --> 00:01:05,667
iCarKits.com.

30
00:01:05,667 --> 00:01:07,634
This was a submission
in advance.

31
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:11,734
Is the owner of iCarKits
in the room?

32
00:01:11,734 --> 00:01:13,734
Excellent.
So I can be mean if I want to.

33
00:01:13,734 --> 00:01:15,367
I can be sarcastic
if I want to.

34
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:16,667
There was some good stuff,

35
00:01:16,667 --> 00:01:18,467
and there was some bad stuff
about this site.

36
00:01:18,467 --> 00:01:20,000
Mostly good, though.

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,367
When you look at it,

38
00:01:21,367 --> 00:01:23,667
what do you think
this site is about?

39
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:27,968
What's the impression
that you get?

40
00:01:27,968 --> 00:01:31,100
They put iPod kits
in cars, right?

41
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,334
That's pretty clear.

42
00:01:32,334 --> 00:01:33,868
So it's a nice thing
that you know

43
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:35,000
what does this site do.

44
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,334
We'll look at a site or two
later on

45
00:01:36,334 --> 00:01:38,200
where it's like,
why does this site exist?

46
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,501
We're not quite sure.

47
00:01:39,501 --> 00:01:41,434
And in fact,
normally I do this

48
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:44,834
at SEO--search engine
optimization--conferences.

49
00:01:44,834 --> 00:01:47,133
And I get a lot
of really bad ones.

50
00:01:47,133 --> 00:01:54,133
Like cheap-hotels-biz-discounts-
online-4you/viagra

51
00:01:54,133 --> 00:01:56,300
or something like that.

52
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,467
And all the submissions
were pretty much white hat,

53
00:01:58,467 --> 00:02:00,734
so I might throw in a few
spam results that we've seen,

54
00:02:00,734 --> 00:02:02,901
just to kind of spice it up
a little bit.

55
00:02:02,901 --> 00:02:04,734
Now, one thing
you might not notice:

56
00:02:04,734 --> 00:02:07,334
I'll bet whoever did
iCarKits.com

57
00:02:07,334 --> 00:02:11,100
is proud of the fact that--
do you see this little iPod?

58
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,734
That's actually active.

59
00:02:12,734 --> 00:02:14,167
It's searchable,

60
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:17,734
which is kind of cute, but you
might not realize it, right?

61
00:02:17,734 --> 00:02:20,267
So let's pretend
I have an Audi.

62
00:02:20,267 --> 00:02:24,434
And let's pretend that I have,
you know, an Audi A4.

63
00:02:24,434 --> 00:02:25,834
So you can click through,

64
00:02:25,834 --> 00:02:27,467
you can pick
a random model year,

65
00:02:27,467 --> 00:02:29,801
and then for that,
do I have navigation?

66
00:02:29,801 --> 00:02:31,501
Sure, yeah, why not.
I've got navigation.

67
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:34,701
For that, you can see
the products that you have.

68
00:02:34,701 --> 00:02:36,033
That's pretty cool.

69
00:02:36,033 --> 00:02:38,200
I haven't actually seen
that sort of active scroller

70
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,334
within a picture, right?

71
00:02:39,334 --> 00:02:41,334
That's kind of engaging.

72
00:02:41,334 --> 00:02:44,167
But do you think
an average user,

73
00:02:44,167 --> 00:02:46,901
who's not necessarily savvy,
who lands on that page

74
00:02:46,901 --> 00:02:49,234
knows to go looking
at the iPod?

75
00:02:49,234 --> 00:02:50,601
Probably not.

76
00:02:50,601 --> 00:02:52,567
So one of the things that we
always try to communicate

77
00:02:52,567 --> 00:02:55,067
is provide multiple ways
to get to a page.

78
00:02:55,067 --> 00:02:56,868
If you can have
drop-down boxes,

79
00:02:56,868 --> 00:02:58,901
these sort of clickable
search stuff,

80
00:02:58,901 --> 00:03:01,400
search engines might be able
to crawl through that.

81
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,601
But it's really nice if you can
have static HTML links,

82
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,234
because the crawler pretty much
only knows how to crawl

83
00:03:07,234 --> 00:03:08,667
through static HTML links.

84
00:03:08,667 --> 00:03:11,133
Now, Google actually
can read JavaScript.

85
00:03:11,133 --> 00:03:14,567
And not just stupid, look
for a URL in the JavaScript.

86
00:03:14,567 --> 00:03:16,667
We can sometimes click
and execute

87
00:03:16,667 --> 00:03:18,801
and try to do really neat things
with JavaScript.

88
00:03:18,801 --> 00:03:20,701
But not every search engine
can do that.

89
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,267
You don't want to make it hard
for the search engines

90
00:03:23,267 --> 00:03:25,033
to get to your site, so you
don't want the search engine

91
00:03:25,033 --> 00:03:28,400
to have to fill out a form
to find these products.

92
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,033
But once you land here,
it's actually pretty good.

93
00:03:31,033 --> 00:03:32,400
Now, one thing that I noticed--

94
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,300
you know, they've got
text phone numbers,

95
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,734
so that's kind of nice--

96
00:03:35,734 --> 00:03:38,400
a lot of people will put their
information in an image, right?

97
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,601
"Free shipping."

98
00:03:39,601 --> 00:03:41,567
See this "free shipping"?
That's an image.

99
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:44,334
Unless you said "free shipping"
in the ALT tag,

100
00:03:44,334 --> 00:03:47,901
there's no way we can actually
read the content of that image.

101
00:03:47,901 --> 00:03:49,501
Now, there are people at Google
who have said,

102
00:03:49,501 --> 00:03:51,534
"We should OCR the entire Web."

103
00:03:51,534 --> 00:03:52,767
Right?

104
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:54,067
We've talked about it, right?

105
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,968
Google Books.
We do OCR our own stuff.

106
00:03:55,968 --> 00:03:58,634
It would be really cool
if we should OCR

107
00:03:58,634 --> 00:04:00,567
"free shipping," you know,
and "enter the discount code,"

108
00:04:00,567 --> 00:04:01,934
and you could index that.

109
00:04:01,934 --> 00:04:03,667
And then if somebody searched
for "iPod car kit,"

110
00:04:03,667 --> 00:04:05,501
with "free shipping,"
we might return that.

111
00:04:05,501 --> 00:04:08,567
But don't rely on search engines
to OCR the entire Web,

112
00:04:08,567 --> 00:04:10,234
'cause it doesn't happen
right now.

113
00:04:10,234 --> 00:04:11,968
It's not going to happen
anytime soon.

114
00:04:11,968 --> 00:04:14,000
So the more you can have
nice links,

115
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,367
like here's the phone number
just in straight text,

116
00:04:16,367 --> 00:04:18,334
the better off that'll work.

117
00:04:18,334 --> 00:04:20,434
What else do you notice
about this?

118
00:04:20,434 --> 00:04:23,667
Anybody notice anything strange
about the URL?

119
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:28,901
The URL is
"advanced_search_result.php?

120
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:31,434
"set_questions=1
sort=4d

121
00:04:31,434 --> 00:04:35,300
&search_question[7]=14."

122
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,133
That's a pretty hard URL
to crawl.

123
00:04:38,133 --> 00:04:40,734
If I were designing this site
from scratch,

124
00:04:40,734 --> 00:04:45,133
I would probably make it
iCarKits.com/products

125
00:04:45,133 --> 00:04:50,968
or catalog/audi/a4/2006, right?

126
00:04:50,968 --> 00:04:52,667
Because you can encode
all those parameters

127
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,334
in a very nice way
that's sort of like

128
00:04:54,334 --> 00:04:56,834
a tree structure,
and anyone could click around.

129
00:04:56,834 --> 00:04:59,501
As long as you have
these sort of, you know,

130
00:04:59,501 --> 00:05:00,934
multiple parameters on the URL

131
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:02,534
where it's almost
like search results,

132
00:05:02,534 --> 00:05:04,968
it's a lot harder for
search engines to get through

133
00:05:04,968 --> 00:05:06,734
and try to find
those sort of sites.

134
00:05:06,734 --> 00:05:08,467
Does that make sense?

135
00:05:08,467 --> 00:05:11,367
So if you can make something
like a very static,

136
00:05:11,367 --> 00:05:14,000
nicely crawlable link
or set of links,

137
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,400
that's going to be
a lot more useful.

138
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,901
I don't want to dwell
on this one too long,

139
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,400
but in general,
it's a pretty good site.

140
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,334
It's crawlable,
you can click around on links,

141
00:05:21,334 --> 00:05:22,834
and you can usually find stuff.

142
00:05:22,834 --> 00:05:24,534
And Google does
a pretty good job on it.

143
00:05:24,534 --> 00:05:27,267
But I did want to mention
one little tidbit.

144
00:05:27,267 --> 00:05:28,968
You're developers, right?

145
00:05:28,968 --> 00:05:30,334
How many people here
are responsible

146
00:05:30,334 --> 00:05:32,033
for a Website
or a blog in some way?

147
00:05:32,033 --> 00:05:34,167
A forum? Okay.

148
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,133
Why do you run your Website?

149
00:05:38,634 --> 00:05:39,834
Say again?

150
00:05:39,834 --> 00:05:41,234
For people to look at it.

151
00:05:41,234 --> 00:05:42,400
Fair enough.

152
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,934
But why do you want them
to look at it?

153
00:05:43,934 --> 00:05:46,167
What do you want them--what do
you want them to get out of it?

154
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,801
To make money.
Exactly.

155
00:05:51,801 --> 00:05:53,467
This guy doesn't want
to educate the world

156
00:05:53,467 --> 00:05:56,100
about how to, you know,
install iPod car kits.

157
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,000
He wants to make money.
And that's okay.

158
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,901
He can provide a great service
and great information.

159
00:06:00,901 --> 00:06:03,267
So ask yourself, what do you
want out of your Website?

160
00:06:03,267 --> 00:06:04,367
I happen to run a blog.

161
00:06:04,367 --> 00:06:05,634
I don't run any ads.

162
00:06:05,634 --> 00:06:08,067
I often ask myself,
"Why do I run my Website?"

163
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,300
Like, what's the point?

164
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,701
I just throw stuff up there
on the Web.

165
00:06:10,701 --> 00:06:13,334
I don't get anybody
to subscribe to newsletters

166
00:06:13,334 --> 00:06:14,400
or anything like that.

167
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,567
So you should ask yourself,

168
00:06:15,567 --> 00:06:16,934
what are you trying to get out
of your Website?

169
00:06:16,934 --> 00:06:18,300
This guy
is trying to get sales.

170
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,200
If you look at the title
of the Website--

171
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,467
I'm gonna hover over it
in Chrome--

172
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:26,434
iPod car adapters--
2006 Audi A6--

173
00:06:26,434 --> 00:06:28,067
This is pretty good.

174
00:06:28,067 --> 00:06:31,167
You notice he has the word
"iPod car."

175
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,567
I would bet you
dollars to doughnuts

176
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:36,234
that probably his top phrase
is "iPod car."

177
00:06:36,234 --> 00:06:38,334
A lot of people
who are caring about phrases,

178
00:06:38,334 --> 00:06:40,267
they'll put that right there
in their title.

179
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:43,667
And I would probably bet you
that he is getting

180
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:46,067
maybe hundreds of visitors
a day, which is pretty good.

181
00:06:46,067 --> 00:06:47,934
If you can get a few of those
to convert

182
00:06:47,934 --> 00:06:51,300
at, you know, 180 bucks a pop,
that's not bad.

183
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,734
But one thing I noticed
when I looked

184
00:06:52,734 --> 00:06:55,000
at this site last night
is he doesn't even mention

185
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,133
the most popular product
for the iPod and cars.

186
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:01,334
So let's see if I can
bring it up.

187
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:04,067
There's a Google AdWords tool,
and I'll warn you in advance

188
00:07:04,067 --> 00:07:06,534
that the Wi-Fi in this room
is a little bit spotty,

189
00:07:06,534 --> 00:07:09,234
so I tried to preload
as many tabs as I could.

190
00:07:09,234 --> 00:07:11,400
But if you go to this tool,
which you can just search for

191
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,834
with "Google AdWords tool"
or "Google keyword tool,"

192
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:16,834
what it will let you do
is it will let you type in

193
00:07:16,834 --> 00:07:18,367
a phrase like "iPod car."

194
00:07:18,367 --> 00:07:20,267
And whenever I did that
last night,

195
00:07:20,267 --> 00:07:21,634
it said,
"You know what?

196
00:07:21,634 --> 00:07:24,200
People type in 'iPod car,'
like, 100 times a day."

197
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,501
What do you think they type in
250,000 times a day?

198
00:07:28,501 --> 00:07:30,367
There's a product called iTrip.

199
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:31,767
It's from Griffin.

200
00:07:31,767 --> 00:07:33,667
And what it does is it turns
your iPhone

201
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:35,300
into a little FM transmitter.

202
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,167
You know, it transmits
over the radio.

203
00:07:37,167 --> 00:07:39,567
The word--
It's starting to come up.

204
00:07:39,567 --> 00:07:42,934
The word "iTrip" does not appear
anywhere on this site.

205
00:07:42,934 --> 00:07:45,501
So if you're a developer,
if you care about making money,

206
00:07:45,501 --> 00:07:47,868
you know, do a little bit
of research.

207
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:50,133
What are the words
that people are going to use

208
00:07:50,133 --> 00:07:51,601
to find your site?

209
00:07:51,601 --> 00:07:55,133
So I solve my little CAPTCHA.
I type in "iPod car."

210
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:57,634
And eventually what it tells you
is, "Hey, one of the big,

211
00:07:57,634 --> 00:07:59,133
"big phrases that people use

212
00:07:59,133 --> 00:08:01,601
in addition to 'iPod car'
is iTrip."

213
00:08:01,601 --> 00:08:03,901
And this site doesn't use
that word once.

214
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:05,133
Question. Yeah.

215
00:08:09,133 --> 00:08:12,234
Mm-hmm.

216
00:08:12,234 --> 00:08:13,567
Absolutely.

217
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,934
So the question is,
"How do you get around

218
00:08:14,934 --> 00:08:16,667
"the fact that, you know,
maybe you don't--

219
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:18,033
maybe you don't sell
the iTrip?"

220
00:08:18,033 --> 00:08:20,033
The fact is, people make,
you know,

221
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:22,133
there are affiliate programs
for the iTrip.

222
00:08:22,133 --> 00:08:25,167
So what you can see right here
is iTrip is queried,

223
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:28,834
like, 240,000 a month in April.

224
00:08:28,834 --> 00:08:31,501
And if you were
to do the query "iTrip,"

225
00:08:31,501 --> 00:08:35,167
um, there's Griffin,
there's all this stuff.

226
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:38,467
I happen to know the guy
that's number one here, right?

227
00:08:38,467 --> 00:08:40,634
And it's one guy in New York.

228
00:08:40,634 --> 00:08:43,234
So it's not that iTrip is
some hugely competitive phrase

229
00:08:43,234 --> 00:08:44,734
that you could never
show up for.

230
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:47,267
They could at least put a page
about the iTrip

231
00:08:47,267 --> 00:08:49,234
and start to show up
for some of those searches.

232
00:08:49,234 --> 00:08:50,567
Now, I don't want to get
too hung up.

233
00:08:50,567 --> 00:08:52,234
We've all--we've spent
almost ten minutes.

234
00:08:52,234 --> 00:08:55,434
So let's, uh, look at a couple
other sites.

235
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:58,067
Um...

236
00:08:58,067 --> 00:09:01,767
is the owner
of fazalfurniture.com

237
00:09:01,767 --> 00:09:04,968
in the room?

238
00:09:04,968 --> 00:09:07,300
Good. Good.
I was hoping they wouldn't be,

239
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,767
um, because I have to give
a little bit of tough love

240
00:09:09,767 --> 00:09:11,667
to fazalfurniture.

241
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:15,834
So here's what the site
looks like.

242
00:09:15,834 --> 00:09:19,634
Uh, notice there's a lot
of bolding on this site.

243
00:09:19,634 --> 00:09:21,634
If you were a visitor
and you landed on this page,

244
00:09:21,634 --> 00:09:26,300
would you be comfortable
with this amount of bolding?

245
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,667
Uh, read a few of the words.

246
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:32,100
It's almost like somebody's not
necessarily a native speaker.

247
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,100
This is the very first thing
a visitor's going to see.

248
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,868
They're--that's going to be
their impression of your site.

249
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:38,400
So what's interesting
is this site

250
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,100
is only about six pages deep.

251
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,200
There's a front page
and then there's a details form

252
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,934
for each one of these phrases.

253
00:09:43,934 --> 00:09:46,367
And what's kind of interesting
is you click to get more details

254
00:09:46,367 --> 00:09:49,334
on this, say, Indonesian chair,
so you get a little picture,

255
00:09:49,334 --> 00:09:52,067
the picture
never gets bigger, right?

256
00:09:52,067 --> 00:09:54,567
"Oh, I want more details.
Yeah, show me a bigger picture."

257
00:09:54,567 --> 00:09:57,000
No, the picture never changes.
It stays the same size.

258
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,501
So there's all kinds of ways

259
00:09:58,501 --> 00:10:01,234
that you could entice people
to order,

260
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:03,501
and they're not necessarily
going to get enough information

261
00:10:03,501 --> 00:10:04,901
to feel comfortable.

262
00:10:04,901 --> 00:10:06,567
There's something else
you need to think about,

263
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:08,701
which is the fit and finish
of your Website.

264
00:10:08,701 --> 00:10:10,767
And we'll go through
a couple examples of that.

265
00:10:10,767 --> 00:10:12,501
Does anybody see anything
that either gives them

266
00:10:12,501 --> 00:10:15,467
a huge amount of confidence
in buying from this site

267
00:10:15,467 --> 00:10:21,100
or maybe a little bit of pause
where they'd worry?

268
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,934
Yeah, the co--
yeah, the contact order,

269
00:10:22,934 --> 00:10:25,334
you know, is--it turns out
it's just a Web form.

270
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:27,567
See this Rattan furniture?

271
00:10:27,567 --> 00:10:29,601
If you click to view details,

272
00:10:29,601 --> 00:10:34,000
uh, they keep spelling Rattan
a different way, right?

273
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,200
And if I were buying
for a motel,

274
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,033
I'd be, like, "Well,
don't you know how to spell

275
00:10:38,033 --> 00:10:40,400
the type of furniture
that you're selling?"

276
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,200
Either you do, in which case
you're deliberately misspelling,

277
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,434
which looks bad, or you don't.

278
00:10:45,434 --> 00:10:48,167
And if you don't know
how to spell the ingredients

279
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:49,767
of your, uh, your furniture,

280
00:10:49,767 --> 00:10:52,334
that's a pretty bad sign
as well.

281
00:10:52,334 --> 00:10:54,767
So this is the sort of thing
where a--

282
00:10:54,767 --> 00:10:55,901
See, right here
they're calling it

283
00:10:55,901 --> 00:10:59,267
"rottan" furniture, right?

284
00:10:59,267 --> 00:11:01,701
And it may very well be
rotten furniture.

285
00:11:01,701 --> 00:11:05,667
We don't know.
But--yeah, go for it.

286
00:11:06,868 --> 00:11:09,167
Can we, uh, get
the other lap up if...

287
00:11:09,167 --> 00:11:10,901
White: Looks like your
background image it's using,

288
00:11:10,901 --> 00:11:14,434
the nice--really nice
word grain is, um, 1 megabyte.

289
00:11:14,434 --> 00:11:15,567
1,000 K.

290
00:11:15,567 --> 00:11:17,567
Cutts: Right.
White: It comes in...

291
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:20,133
Cutts: No wonder my page load
is failing.

292
00:11:20,133 --> 00:11:23,701
A one--
yeah, a one-megabyte download--

293
00:11:23,701 --> 00:11:26,200
Okay, so we have pretty good
connectivity here.

294
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,801
My in-laws live in Omaha.

295
00:11:27,801 --> 00:11:30,601
So, like, every Christmas,
I have to go to Omaha.

296
00:11:30,601 --> 00:11:32,133
And I try to load
the Google home page.

297
00:11:32,133 --> 00:11:34,767
And for a long time,
they were on dial-up.

298
00:11:34,767 --> 00:11:37,000
How long do you think it took me
to load the Google home page,

299
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,634
which is the most spartan,
austere page, like, on the Web?

300
00:11:40,634 --> 00:11:43,133
Like 12 seconds on a modem.

301
00:11:43,133 --> 00:11:46,167
If you want to load
a one-megabyte background,

302
00:11:46,167 --> 00:11:48,133
you can pretty much start
at, you know--at the beginning

303
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:49,501
of this session
and then come back

304
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:50,901
at the end of this session.

305
00:11:50,901 --> 00:11:52,501
And then by the time
you're done, you're like,

306
00:11:52,501 --> 00:11:55,767
"Oh, this site sort of sucks
a little bit," right?

307
00:11:55,767 --> 00:11:58,100
So pay attention
to the fit and finish.

308
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,767
Pay attention
to how it looks for the users,

309
00:11:59,767 --> 00:12:02,767
because if the users like it,
you'll get more conversions.

310
00:12:02,767 --> 00:12:04,634
And it can be all kinds
of little things.

311
00:12:04,634 --> 00:12:06,200
For example, "about us."

312
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,434
Oh, good, I can find out more
about this person.

313
00:12:08,434 --> 00:12:10,567
Click. Click. Click.

314
00:12:10,567 --> 00:12:13,868
Crap, It's not a link, right?

315
00:12:13,868 --> 00:12:15,534
So on one hand, this guy's done
a pretty good job.

316
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:16,868
He's bought some sort
of template

317
00:12:16,868 --> 00:12:18,167
or something like that.

318
00:12:18,167 --> 00:12:20,534
So it's got a "contact us"
and "about us"

319
00:12:20,534 --> 00:12:22,167
and "home page."

320
00:12:22,167 --> 00:12:24,234
But he didn't have
an "about us" page

321
00:12:24,234 --> 00:12:27,234
so he just left
that text lying there.

322
00:12:27,234 --> 00:12:29,167
And that's not necessarily
very helpful.

323
00:12:29,167 --> 00:12:30,701
So pay attention
to the fit and finish.

324
00:12:30,701 --> 00:12:33,868
Pay attention to your images,
how fast things download.

325
00:12:33,868 --> 00:12:35,501
Please don't
call your furniture "rottan"

326
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:37,100
if you're trying to spell it.

327
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,400
And think about how the user's
going to perceive it.

328
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,434
There's a lot
of key words here, right?

329
00:12:41,434 --> 00:12:45,033
He--How many times does this guy
use the word "furniture"?

330
00:12:45,033 --> 00:12:47,033
A lot, right?

331
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:48,367
It's not the case

332
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:51,300
that if you repeat the word
"furniture" 100 times,

333
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,334
you will do twice as well
in Google

334
00:12:53,334 --> 00:12:56,000
as if you say the word
"furniture" 50 times.

335
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,234
I promise you.
We're pretty smart about that.

336
00:12:58,234 --> 00:12:59,767
After the first two
or three times,

337
00:12:59,767 --> 00:13:02,634
it ain't going to help
to say it 85 more times.

338
00:13:02,634 --> 00:13:05,367
So he doesn't need to say,
"Furniture, furniture,

339
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:06,701
furniture, furniture,
furniture."

340
00:13:06,701 --> 00:13:08,167
If someone talked like this,

341
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:11,400
they'd be the most annoying
person in the world, right?

342
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,000
So you may work with SEOs.
You may be an SEO.

343
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,133
And you may get this question,

344
00:13:15,133 --> 00:13:17,734
"Well, what should
my keyword density be?"

345
00:13:17,734 --> 00:13:19,601
Don't worry
about your keyword density.

346
00:13:19,601 --> 00:13:21,467
If you have the word
on your page two, three times,

347
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,601
Google knows about that word.

348
00:13:23,601 --> 00:13:25,200
Think about reading it
out loud.

349
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,701
If it sounds
like something normal

350
00:13:26,701 --> 00:13:28,400
if someone were reading it
out loud,

351
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,968
that's pretty good.

352
00:13:29,968 --> 00:13:31,601
It doesn't need to be
like you're a bot

353
00:13:31,601 --> 00:13:34,000
saying the word "furniture"
over and over and over again.

354
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,434
And there's a few
interesting things here.

355
00:13:36,434 --> 00:13:38,701
He focuses
on the word "furniture,"

356
00:13:38,701 --> 00:13:41,501
but he could probably think
about other synonyms, right?

357
00:13:41,501 --> 00:13:42,868
Go to the Google keyword tool.

358
00:13:42,868 --> 00:13:44,634
There's lots of keyword tools
around the Web.

359
00:13:44,634 --> 00:13:46,133
What are some other words
for "furniture"

360
00:13:46,133 --> 00:13:48,400
that he could use
instead of "furniture"?

361
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,834
That's the sort of thing
that users might type in.

362
00:13:52,701 --> 00:13:54,868
Okay, so here's
a little interlude.

363
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:58,968
Savetheinternet.com is dedicated
to net neutrality,

364
00:13:58,968 --> 00:14:00,701
Internet heroes and villains.

365
00:14:00,701 --> 00:14:03,067
It's, uh, hosted by Free Press.

366
00:14:03,067 --> 00:14:04,400
This is a cool site.

367
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,901
This is a site
which is about issues.

368
00:14:05,901 --> 00:14:08,467
This is a site about spreading
the word on net neutrality,

369
00:14:08,467 --> 00:14:12,400
which, personally, I think
is a pretty cool idea,

370
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,567
except...

371
00:14:15,567 --> 00:14:18,334
See this, uh--
see, I was on savetheinternet.

372
00:14:18,334 --> 00:14:20,968
I'm going to go check out
their blog.

373
00:14:20,968 --> 00:14:22,367
So I go and I try to access

374
00:14:22,367 --> 00:14:28,167
blog/wp-content/uploads/authors
/pleddle.html.

375
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,300
What do you think--
assuming the Wi-Fi holds--

376
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,701
what do you think
I'm going to land on

377
00:14:32,701 --> 00:14:35,901
if I'm looking
at this site's blog?

378
00:14:35,901 --> 00:14:39,400
Am I going to learn more
about net neutrality?

379
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,200
Am I going to learn
about freedom of the press?

380
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,367
If you look down here,

381
00:14:43,367 --> 00:14:46,567
now it's waiting
for healthshoponline.

382
00:14:46,567 --> 00:14:48,667
Why is a site
about net neutrality

383
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:51,567
linking me
to healthshoponline?

384
00:14:51,567 --> 00:14:54,367
It turns out this site
has been hacked.

385
00:14:54,367 --> 00:14:59,634
And if you visit the blog,
you'll be offered VIAGRA, okay?

386
00:14:59,634 --> 00:15:01,334
So the point that I want
to get across--

387
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:02,400
and here it comes.

388
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,601
Canadian Pharmacy.

389
00:15:03,601 --> 00:15:06,667
Number-one Internet online
drug store, right?

390
00:15:06,667 --> 00:15:08,167
You guys, as developers,

391
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:11,934
are due for, like,
the most concentrated attack

392
00:15:11,934 --> 00:15:14,133
of hackers
that you would believe.

393
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:16,234
It used to be people
would get individual PCs

394
00:15:16,234 --> 00:15:17,667
and hack their botnets.

395
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:18,968
And as PCs get better,

396
00:15:18,968 --> 00:15:20,834
as more people roll out things
like Windows 7

397
00:15:20,834 --> 00:15:22,067
or switch to a Mac

398
00:15:22,067 --> 00:15:24,133
or use different browsers
that are more hardened,

399
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:26,167
the clients are--
are getting pretty good.

400
00:15:26,167 --> 00:15:28,434
It's hard to hack
one of these bots--

401
00:15:28,434 --> 00:15:30,033
one of these PCs.

402
00:15:30,033 --> 00:15:32,868
So now people are going
to be attacking your Web server.

403
00:15:32,868 --> 00:15:36,000
So you have to keep
your server patched.

404
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,334
This savetheinternet,
I've been to it before.

405
00:15:38,334 --> 00:15:40,601
I was like, "Oh, what are they
doing selling pills?"

406
00:15:40,601 --> 00:15:42,667
And it turns out, you know,
if you click on "blog,"

407
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:45,367
it says something like, uh,
"We've been hacked.

408
00:15:45,367 --> 00:15:47,367
We're trying to figure out
what's going on."

409
00:15:47,367 --> 00:15:50,934
And yet the hack
is still live, right?

410
00:15:50,934 --> 00:15:53,067
So as soon as you find out
that you've been hacked,

411
00:15:53,067 --> 00:15:54,334
take it all down.

412
00:15:54,334 --> 00:15:56,234
Go ahead,
restore from backups.

413
00:15:56,234 --> 00:15:59,100
You have to apply your
server stuff really frequently.

414
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,000
So stuff like WordPress,
for example,

415
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,300
comes out with relatively
frequent updates,

416
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,901
and it's relatively easy.

417
00:16:04,901 --> 00:16:06,601
So now they've gotten
the blog back,

418
00:16:06,601 --> 00:16:09,934
but they don't realize that
they're still selling pills.

419
00:16:09,934 --> 00:16:11,534
So if you have a site,

420
00:16:11,534 --> 00:16:14,000
one thing that I would
absolutely recommend,

421
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,467
just run it as a daily search,

422
00:16:15,467 --> 00:16:19,734
or set it up in, you know, uh,
just a cron job or something.

423
00:16:19,734 --> 00:16:23,267
Do site:yourdomain.com
VIAGRA.

424
00:16:23,267 --> 00:16:26,734
Or site:yourdomain.com pills,
or online gambling,

425
00:16:26,734 --> 00:16:28,167
or XENICAL,
or Hydrocodone.

426
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:30,133
You know, pick your favorite
debt consolidation,

427
00:16:30,133 --> 00:16:32,100
mortgages,
spammy kind of query,

428
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,367
because if you're hacked,

429
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,901
then you'll find out
about it really soon,

430
00:16:34,901 --> 00:16:36,667
and you'll be able to fix it
before it starts to effect

431
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:38,534
your search rankings.

432
00:16:38,534 --> 00:16:41,400
Questions about that?
Make sense? Yeah.

433
00:16:46,033 --> 00:16:48,133
Yeah. Yep.

434
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,968
Yep. Yeah.

435
00:16:57,968 --> 00:17:00,567
So the--the question is,
"If you use WordPress,

436
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:02,834
you know, it's pretty easy
to get hacked."

437
00:17:02,834 --> 00:17:05,367
And the fact is, WordPress
has gotten much, much better.

438
00:17:05,367 --> 00:17:06,934
You know, they're including
one-time keys,

439
00:17:06,934 --> 00:17:09,100
all sorts of nonces,
things that protect you.

440
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,234
So 2.7.1, 2.7.0

441
00:17:11,234 --> 00:17:13,033
are a lot less likely
to be hacked.

442
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:14,400
But if you use
a stupid password--

443
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,100
like, suppose their admin
password was "savetheinternet,"

444
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,200
people could still guess it.

445
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,334
People can still hack it.

446
00:17:19,334 --> 00:17:20,767
We're actually in the process--

447
00:17:20,767 --> 00:17:23,968
there's a--there's a site,
google.com/webmasters,

448
00:17:23,968 --> 00:17:25,934
and whenever we see your site
get hacked,

449
00:17:25,934 --> 00:17:27,601
we will often try
to send you a message

450
00:17:27,601 --> 00:17:30,701
and say, "Hey, we found the
following text on your page."

451
00:17:30,701 --> 00:17:33,400
Now, we can't detect that you're
hacked every single time.

452
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,000
But one thing that we've done
is we've scanned

453
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,701
for obsolete versions
of software.

454
00:17:36,701 --> 00:17:37,767
And we've said,

455
00:17:37,767 --> 00:17:39,234
"Okay, if you're running
WordPress 2.1.0,

456
00:17:39,234 --> 00:17:42,567
you're basically naked
on the Internet," right?

457
00:17:42,567 --> 00:17:45,334
If you're running a version
of WordPress, you know, 2.2.1,

458
00:17:45,334 --> 00:17:46,634
you're still naked
on the Internet.

459
00:17:46,634 --> 00:17:47,801
And it's not WordPress.

460
00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:49,067
It's Joomla!,
it's, uh, you know,

461
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:50,701
all sorts of different--
Drupal--

462
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:53,100
all these packages have had
holes at different times.

463
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,501
So Google will try
to give you a warning,

464
00:17:54,501 --> 00:17:56,834
but we don't guarantee you
that we'll warn you.

465
00:17:56,834 --> 00:17:57,834
Yeah.

466
00:17:57,834 --> 00:18:00,834
[man speaking indistinctly]

467
00:18:06,067 --> 00:18:07,067
Yeah.

468
00:18:07,067 --> 00:18:08,934
[man speaking indistinctly]

469
00:18:08,934 --> 00:18:10,133
Yeah. Yeah.

470
00:18:10,133 --> 00:18:12,667
So we can take it offline
a little bit.

471
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:13,834
But the basic idea is,

472
00:18:13,834 --> 00:18:15,334
if you notice
that you've been hacked,

473
00:18:15,334 --> 00:18:17,267
take your site down,
restore from backups,

474
00:18:17,267 --> 00:18:19,400
make sure that you're
as secure as possible.

475
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,534
And then you can do what's known
as a reconsideration request,

476
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:23,067
at least for Google.

477
00:18:23,067 --> 00:18:25,167
And that says, "Hey, we're okay.
We've cleaned up the hack."

478
00:18:25,167 --> 00:18:27,067
We also have
a Google Webmaster forum.

479
00:18:27,067 --> 00:18:29,167
And that's linked to
from google.com/webmasters.

480
00:18:29,167 --> 00:18:31,234
So that's a couple ways
you can let Google know

481
00:18:31,234 --> 00:18:34,133
that things are, uh--
are fixed.

482
00:18:34,133 --> 00:18:35,801
So this one's
kind of an interesting site.

483
00:18:35,801 --> 00:18:41,334
This is HIV InSite at ucf--
ucsf.edu.

484
00:18:41,334 --> 00:18:42,601
Pretty cool site.

485
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:45,300
Um, I noticed
a-a couple interesting things.

486
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,400
Number one,
they're really not using

487
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,767
very much of this page.

488
00:18:50,767 --> 00:18:52,334
So if you want to see
what's going on,

489
00:18:52,334 --> 00:18:53,701
you have to go
all the way down here

490
00:18:53,701 --> 00:18:55,267
to see there's--there's basics.

491
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:57,100
There's different sort
of things.

492
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,400
The other thing--

493
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,767
so I'll go ahead and use
the rest of this space

494
00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:01,100
by making the font bigger.

495
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,167
Um, check out this one.

496
00:19:06,801 --> 00:19:08,901
Recommendations
for Use of Antiretroviral Drugs

497
00:19:08,901 --> 00:19:11,501
in Pregnant HIV-1-Infected Women
for Maternal Health

498
00:19:11,501 --> 00:19:14,434
and Interventions to Reduce
Perinatal HIV-1 Transmission

499
00:19:14,434 --> 00:19:15,801
in the United States.

500
00:19:15,801 --> 00:19:18,234
What is that about?

501
00:19:18,234 --> 00:19:20,968
I have no idea.

502
00:19:20,968 --> 00:19:23,000
I'm not an HIV expert.

503
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,601
Is this the very first thing
that you want your users to see?

504
00:19:26,601 --> 00:19:28,000
Maybe it is.

505
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,267
Maybe this public-health site
really wants to highlight

506
00:19:30,267 --> 00:19:33,334
what are the important
medical papers coming out.

507
00:19:33,334 --> 00:19:34,968
But if you're taking the time--

508
00:19:34,968 --> 00:19:37,234
And notice this says,
"Editors' Picks."

509
00:19:37,234 --> 00:19:41,701
So someone at UCSF has decided
that that's an important paper.

510
00:19:41,701 --> 00:19:42,968
If you're taking the time
to decide

511
00:19:42,968 --> 00:19:44,234
that's an important paper,

512
00:19:44,234 --> 00:19:47,734
include, like, a paragraph
of beginner language.

513
00:19:47,734 --> 00:19:48,901
What does this mean?

514
00:19:48,901 --> 00:19:51,968
"Oh, if you are a new mother,

515
00:19:51,968 --> 00:19:54,834
"it will help you
if you do the following steps.

516
00:19:54,834 --> 00:19:57,167
Click here to read more."
Right?

517
00:19:57,167 --> 00:19:59,501
So what's really interesting
is if you go down to the bottom,

518
00:19:59,501 --> 00:20:02,501
there's a section
called "Basics."

519
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:04,334
And I'll just tell you,
you know,

520
00:20:04,334 --> 00:20:06,934
it's possible
that you can go to Google,

521
00:20:06,934 --> 00:20:09,834
and you can, uh--
if you go to Google

522
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,767
and--and stand in the lobby,

523
00:20:11,767 --> 00:20:14,400
you can see queries
streaming by.

524
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,801
And if you ever do that,

525
00:20:15,801 --> 00:20:17,400
what you'll find
is that typically,

526
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,801
the sort of queries
that show up

527
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,901
are not HIV transmission

528
00:20:20,901 --> 00:20:23,033
in maternal
blah blah blah blah blah.

529
00:20:23,033 --> 00:20:26,000
Here's what people type.
Make it really big.

530
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,200
[hums]

531
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:35,901
You'd be surprised
how many people type

532
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:39,968
those queries, right?

533
00:20:39,968 --> 00:20:41,133
"Aah!

534
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:42,267
"I went to the doctor.

535
00:20:42,267 --> 00:20:44,033
"The doctor used this really
long phrase.

536
00:20:44,033 --> 00:20:45,868
"And I don't know
if this is a serious disease

537
00:20:45,868 --> 00:20:47,467
or not, you know?"

538
00:20:47,467 --> 00:20:49,834
So people who come to Google
type in things like this.

539
00:20:49,834 --> 00:20:51,033
You'd be amazed.

540
00:20:51,033 --> 00:20:53,367
Something like 25%
of all the queries we get

541
00:20:53,367 --> 00:20:55,033
in a given month are unique.

542
00:20:55,033 --> 00:20:57,000
And it's because
it goes straight down deep

543
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,334
into the long tail.

544
00:20:58,334 --> 00:20:59,934
And they use beginner language.

545
00:20:59,934 --> 00:21:03,968
They are not using language
like, uh...

546
00:21:05,234 --> 00:21:07,234
You know,
here's the Basics section.

547
00:21:07,234 --> 00:21:10,934
"What are HIV and AIDS?"
"Should I get tested for HIV?"

548
00:21:10,934 --> 00:21:12,000
How about this question.

549
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,400
"I just tested positive --
now what?"

550
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,133
"I just tested negative --
now what?"

551
00:21:15,133 --> 00:21:17,033
If you are designing this purely
for users,

552
00:21:17,033 --> 00:21:19,834
I would probably put this
section front and center, right?

553
00:21:19,834 --> 00:21:22,534
And move the research papers
a little bit further down,

554
00:21:22,534 --> 00:21:24,400
'cause if I'm a user,
I have to click a lot further

555
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,601
to find this.

556
00:21:25,601 --> 00:21:27,200
I just happened to see
the Basics section.

557
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,100
This is the part that's going
to be of a lot more interest

558
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,467
to your average user.

559
00:21:30,467 --> 00:21:33,100
So, you know, when people
come to Google

560
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,267
and they start typing this,

561
00:21:35,267 --> 00:21:37,033
this is actually
a pretty good match

562
00:21:37,033 --> 00:21:38,367
for this sort of thing.

563
00:21:38,367 --> 00:21:40,000
So there's a ton
of good resources here,

564
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,033
but you might think
about rejuggling a little bit

565
00:21:42,033 --> 00:21:43,334
so it's
a little more crawlable,

566
00:21:43,334 --> 00:21:45,534
a little more,
um, understandable.

567
00:21:45,534 --> 00:21:48,601
So we call this, like,
the disconnect in jargon.

568
00:21:48,601 --> 00:21:52,434
Any of you guys
do industry sites with heavy--

569
00:21:52,434 --> 00:21:55,634
yeah, like,
technical language?

570
00:21:55,634 --> 00:21:58,901
Think about what the user
is going to type, right?

571
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:01,634
That guy who was doing
iPod car integration,

572
00:22:01,634 --> 00:22:05,100
he's completely ignoring
the 250,000 people last month

573
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,534
who said, "iTrip."

574
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:10,400
He doesn't even have a mention
of that product on his page.

575
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,567
In the same way, this site,
while very good--

576
00:22:12,567 --> 00:22:15,434
in fact,
very crawlable, right?--

577
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:17,868
sort of doesn't necessarily
match with the terms

578
00:22:17,868 --> 00:22:19,133
that users are going to use.

579
00:22:19,133 --> 00:22:20,834
And you want to think
about the first impression

580
00:22:20,834 --> 00:22:23,534
you have whenever you land
on a page.

581
00:22:23,534 --> 00:22:26,634
Does that make sense?
Cool.

582
00:22:26,634 --> 00:22:29,167
All right.
Let's look at another site.

583
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,133
Ah.
What do you think?

584
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:41,334
This is what my team sees
all day, every day,

585
00:22:41,334 --> 00:22:42,667
all day long.

586
00:22:42,667 --> 00:22:45,634
Uh, blogsense.biz.

587
00:22:45,634 --> 00:22:48,567
Uh, post number 1,276.

588
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,968
So he's done 1,275
previous blog posts

589
00:22:50,968 --> 00:22:53,067
just like this.

590
00:22:53,067 --> 00:22:55,234
"Radmaxx kicker fx,
phantom electric scooter,

591
00:22:55,234 --> 00:22:58,601
used electric scooter,
schwin, new."

592
00:22:58,601 --> 00:23:01,734
So don't do
this kind of stuff, right?

593
00:23:01,734 --> 00:23:04,033
If you ever get somebody
coming to you and saying,

594
00:23:04,033 --> 00:23:07,200
"Hey, uh, we've got an idea
to generate

595
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,901
"a lot of envelope pages,
hallway pages, doorway pages,

596
00:23:12,901 --> 00:23:14,834
shadow domains,
whatever you want to call them."

597
00:23:14,834 --> 00:23:16,100
A lot of things that--

598
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,434
"Oh, it's okay.
there's no spam on your domain.

599
00:23:18,434 --> 00:23:20,167
"We put the spam
on other places,

600
00:23:20,167 --> 00:23:22,801
and then we sort of funnel them
in your direction."

601
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:25,133
Users hate this kind of stuff.

602
00:23:25,133 --> 00:23:26,601
Check out the previous post.

603
00:23:26,601 --> 00:23:30,400
"Aamaryland Child Support
Check myIowa," right?

604
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,834
It's pretty much
complete gibberish.

605
00:23:32,834 --> 00:23:35,334
And I hope that programmers
in the audience

606
00:23:35,334 --> 00:23:38,734
are not thinking, "How could I
generate a page like this?"

607
00:23:38,734 --> 00:23:39,868
I'll tell you right now,

608
00:23:39,868 --> 00:23:41,501
they use things
like Hidden Markov Models.

609
00:23:41,501 --> 00:23:43,067
They scrape search results.

610
00:23:43,067 --> 00:23:44,534
They try to find out
search results--

611
00:23:44,534 --> 00:23:46,534
search queries
that people have done.

612
00:23:46,534 --> 00:23:49,033
But the nice thing is this stuff
is pretty detectable.

613
00:23:49,033 --> 00:23:52,334
Uh, it's relatively rare
to see pages like this

614
00:23:52,334 --> 00:23:53,667
on the Web these days.

615
00:23:53,667 --> 00:23:55,601
Or they exist on the Web,
but you're less likely

616
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,634
to find them
through search engines.

617
00:23:57,634 --> 00:24:00,334
Notice that even the spammer's
getting spammed.

618
00:24:00,334 --> 00:24:01,968
He's got a WordPress template,
and it says,

619
00:24:01,968 --> 00:24:04,434
"Download movies,
mortgage calculator gadgets,"

620
00:24:04,434 --> 00:24:06,434
and he's got little links
down at the bottom.

621
00:24:06,434 --> 00:24:09,901
So a lot of this stuff
is just completely awful links.

622
00:24:09,901 --> 00:24:11,534
The reason why I wanted
to show you this one

623
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:14,467
is a lot of the times,
people come to me--

624
00:24:14,467 --> 00:24:17,100
And I'm guessing almost everyone
in this audience

625
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,300
is going to be, "Okay,
should I break my articles

626
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,767
"into multiple pages?

627
00:24:21,767 --> 00:24:23,601
"You know, what if I have
a one-page thing

628
00:24:23,601 --> 00:24:25,400
"where I can print
the entire article?

629
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,300
Is that going to be
duplicate content?"

630
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,133
It's amazing to me
how many white hat people come,

631
00:24:29,133 --> 00:24:30,501
and they're worried
about something

632
00:24:30,501 --> 00:24:32,234
that's, like, you know--

633
00:24:32,234 --> 00:24:33,601
I can understand
why they're worried,

634
00:24:33,601 --> 00:24:35,501
but they really don't need
to worry nearly as much

635
00:24:35,501 --> 00:24:37,267
as these guys.

636
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:39,367
The black hat guys
don't skirt the line.

637
00:24:39,367 --> 00:24:41,601
They go--boosh--
right through that barrier

638
00:24:41,601 --> 00:24:43,868
and break through it
and go as fast as they can

639
00:24:43,868 --> 00:24:46,667
toward the keyword stuff
and sort of spam stuff.

640
00:24:46,667 --> 00:24:49,634
So, uh, it's natural
that people worry

641
00:24:49,634 --> 00:24:50,701
about different things.

642
00:24:50,701 --> 00:24:51,801
But most of the times,

643
00:24:51,801 --> 00:24:54,267
you don't need
to stress that much.

644
00:24:54,267 --> 00:24:56,701
Okay, let's look
at another one--

645
00:24:56,701 --> 00:24:59,501
Comfortfeetshop.com.

646
00:25:01,234 --> 00:25:02,734
What do you like,
and what do you dislike?

647
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:04,234
Get a little
audience participation.

648
00:25:04,234 --> 00:25:07,534
What do you think is good
about this page?

649
00:25:07,534 --> 00:25:08,601
There's some pictures.

650
00:25:08,601 --> 00:25:11,000
Someone else was saying
something else?

651
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,234
Brands--
actual brand names, yes.

652
00:25:13,234 --> 00:25:15,434
Mephisto.
I've heard of that.

653
00:25:15,434 --> 00:25:16,968
ECCO.
I've heard of that.

654
00:25:16,968 --> 00:25:19,167
Okay, what do you dislike?

655
00:25:21,634 --> 00:25:24,734
Brands. There's--there's a lot
of brands here.

656
00:25:24,734 --> 00:25:27,400
Now, and you said--

657
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,567
Yes, yeah, this--
things need to be centered.

658
00:25:30,567 --> 00:25:31,901
You know, it's kind of weird

659
00:25:31,901 --> 00:25:33,567
that it's left-justified here.
and centered here.

660
00:25:33,567 --> 00:25:36,000
That's a little strange.

661
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,167
The text is really weird.
Look at this.

662
00:25:38,167 --> 00:25:40,801
Oh, yeah, I would like to buy
some Cole Haan.

663
00:25:40,801 --> 00:25:44,067
I can't buy it.
It won't let me buy it.

664
00:25:44,067 --> 00:25:47,067
Please, give me
some Cole Haan, right?

665
00:25:47,067 --> 00:25:49,834
So number one,
that text looks a little--

666
00:25:49,834 --> 00:25:52,534
sub-optimal is a polite way
to say it.

667
00:25:52,534 --> 00:25:54,100
And number two,
it's not even clickable.

668
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,534
So if you do want to get
some Cole Haan,

669
00:25:55,534 --> 00:25:57,534
you can't click on it
and get to it.

670
00:25:57,534 --> 00:26:00,501
It turns out the secret is...

671
00:26:00,501 --> 00:26:05,133
that the individual images
are clickable.

672
00:26:05,133 --> 00:26:06,834
So there's a really good
principle of Web design,

673
00:26:06,834 --> 00:26:09,100
which is,
"Keep it simple, stupid," right?

674
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,567
And that is users are just
going to click on random things

675
00:26:12,567 --> 00:26:14,067
all over the place, everywhere.

676
00:26:14,067 --> 00:26:17,167
And so imagine--imagine
if you have an RSS icon,

677
00:26:17,167 --> 00:26:20,067
and you have RSS feed
as anchor text.

678
00:26:20,067 --> 00:26:22,167
Make both
of those clickable, right?

679
00:26:22,167 --> 00:26:24,133
In the same way you want
to make the image clickable

680
00:26:24,133 --> 00:26:25,634
and the text clickable.

681
00:26:25,634 --> 00:26:27,767
Don't put it, you know,
a lot of the times,

682
00:26:27,767 --> 00:26:29,534
you can learn something
by saying, "You know what?

683
00:26:29,534 --> 00:26:31,133
Let's get a regular user."

684
00:26:31,133 --> 00:26:33,234
I swear, probably the best $20
you can spend

685
00:26:33,234 --> 00:26:35,601
is grab a regular person
off the street,

686
00:26:35,601 --> 00:26:37,133
put them in front
of your Web page,

687
00:26:37,133 --> 00:26:38,267
sit on your hands--

688
00:26:38,267 --> 00:26:40,234
you're not allowed
to say anything--

689
00:26:40,234 --> 00:26:42,534
and watch them
try to buy, right?

690
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:44,100
And so if they tried
to click on this--

691
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,767
Of course, the Wi-Fi's gone.

692
00:26:45,767 --> 00:26:49,200
If, uh--if they try
to click on a--on text

693
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,934
and they can't get to the brands
that they want to buy,

694
00:26:51,934 --> 00:26:54,934
they get really irritated
by that.

695
00:26:54,934 --> 00:26:56,534
While we're waiting
for this page to load,

696
00:26:56,534 --> 00:26:58,834
what do you notice
about the URL?

697
00:27:01,334 --> 00:27:02,434
It is meaningless.

698
00:27:02,434 --> 00:27:03,901
There's no way a user

699
00:27:03,901 --> 00:27:06,367
can remember
this particular URL.

700
00:27:06,367 --> 00:27:10,267
In fact, did you notice it has
an exclamation point in it?

701
00:27:10,267 --> 00:27:12,267
You don't see URLs
with exclamation points in them

702
00:27:12,267 --> 00:27:13,734
very often.

703
00:27:13,734 --> 00:27:16,467
And, in fact,
if you looked at the home page,

704
00:27:16,467 --> 00:27:19,133
the, uh--see if I can hit
the back button

705
00:27:19,133 --> 00:27:23,501
without hitting reload--
the URL was this, right?

706
00:27:23,501 --> 00:27:25,801
So there's clearly
a content-management system--

707
00:27:25,801 --> 00:27:28,734
a CMS--that is loading
the home page,

708
00:27:28,734 --> 00:27:31,934
which is homepage.template.

709
00:27:31,934 --> 00:27:33,067
I like to call this,

710
00:27:33,067 --> 00:27:35,300
"When you're fighting
with your CMS."

711
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,701
You shouldn't have to fight
with your CMS.

712
00:27:37,701 --> 00:27:40,267
Whenever you have, "Oh, yeah,
go to the product URL,

713
00:27:40,267 --> 00:27:45,400
it's just gez!mep
yada yada yada,"

714
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,200
users are not going
to remember that as much.

715
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,801
Search engines are barely
going to be able to crawl that.

716
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:55,267
So if you can go
to comfortfeetshop.com,

717
00:27:55,267 --> 00:27:56,667
see, even then,
it still redirects me

718
00:27:56,667 --> 00:27:58,734
to the deep URL.

719
00:27:58,734 --> 00:28:00,567
And so if you can,
it's much better

720
00:28:00,567 --> 00:28:01,968
if you can stick
with short URLs,

721
00:28:01,968 --> 00:28:03,467
if they can be very memorable,

722
00:28:03,467 --> 00:28:05,501
if you don't have to fight
with your CMS.

723
00:28:05,501 --> 00:28:07,667
And the thing is, it's 2009.

724
00:28:07,667 --> 00:28:09,701
We shouldn't be fighting
with CMSes at this point.

725
00:28:09,701 --> 00:28:11,033
If there's a CMS
that isn't built

726
00:28:11,033 --> 00:28:12,467
to be search engine friendly,

727
00:28:12,467 --> 00:28:16,534
consider going
to a different CMS, right?

728
00:28:16,534 --> 00:28:18,234
Be that voice that says,
"You know what?

729
00:28:18,234 --> 00:28:19,901
"If the CMS hasn't even thought

730
00:28:19,901 --> 00:28:21,901
"about what search engines
might do,

731
00:28:21,901 --> 00:28:23,067
"maybe you need to switch

732
00:28:23,067 --> 00:28:24,701
to something
a little bit different."

733
00:28:24,701 --> 00:28:26,934
Does that make sense?

734
00:28:26,934 --> 00:28:29,267
Yeah, question.

735
00:28:43,467 --> 00:28:45,601
All right, so we'll do this--
we'll do one go around,

736
00:28:45,601 --> 00:28:47,300
which is
this power-user question,

737
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,300
which is, suppose
I've got two links on a page.

738
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,434
They both go
to the same place.

739
00:28:51,434 --> 00:28:54,234
Should I put a rel="nofollow"
on one of those links?

740
00:28:54,234 --> 00:28:57,067
So first let's back up and talk
about what nofollow is.

741
00:28:57,067 --> 00:28:59,334
Nofollow is a simple attribute
that you can put on links

742
00:28:59,334 --> 00:29:00,467
that says, "you know what?

743
00:29:00,467 --> 00:29:02,200
Don't necessarily float
page rank.

744
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,467
Don't necessarily float
anchor text across this link."

745
00:29:05,467 --> 00:29:06,801
And my short answer is no.

746
00:29:06,801 --> 00:29:08,467
In general,
whenever you're linking around

747
00:29:08,467 --> 00:29:10,868
within your site,
don't use nofollow.

748
00:29:10,868 --> 00:29:12,767
Just go ahead and link
to whatever stuff.

749
00:29:12,767 --> 00:29:15,701
And the site architecture
that you decide to use

750
00:29:15,701 --> 00:29:18,234
decides where the page rank
flows within your site.

751
00:29:18,234 --> 00:29:20,300
That's why if you have
a treelike structure

752
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,434
and you have
the most important stuff first,

753
00:29:22,434 --> 00:29:23,868
it'll get the most page rank,

754
00:29:23,868 --> 00:29:26,901
because most people link
to the root of your page.

755
00:29:26,901 --> 00:29:29,434
So you remember
the HIV InSite one, right?

756
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,868
They had
the medical articles up front,

757
00:29:31,868 --> 00:29:33,734
and then the basics
were down here,

758
00:29:33,734 --> 00:29:35,801
buried two or three
mouse clicks deep.

759
00:29:35,801 --> 00:29:38,167
That's a good argument
to swap those two.

760
00:29:38,167 --> 00:29:40,100
You'll get more page rank
for the Basics

761
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,400
and the deep medical articles
that less people are interested

762
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,501
are further down.

763
00:29:43,501 --> 00:29:44,801
So a good way
to think about it--

764
00:29:44,801 --> 00:29:47,067
and it works for search engines
as well as for users--

765
00:29:47,067 --> 00:29:50,501
is how many
mouse clicks away am I?

766
00:29:50,501 --> 00:29:52,100
How many mouse clicks
does it take

767
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,400
to buy your
iPod car integration?

768
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,834
How many mouse clicks
does it take

769
00:29:55,834 --> 00:29:58,100
to buy your women's sandals?

770
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:01,868
So that is almost
kind of a good proxy

771
00:30:01,868 --> 00:30:03,367
of page rank,

772
00:30:03,367 --> 00:30:05,701
because page rank
is like a random surfer.

773
00:30:05,701 --> 00:30:06,868
Whenever we find a page,

774
00:30:06,868 --> 00:30:09,634
we extract
all the outgoing links.

775
00:30:09,634 --> 00:30:10,801
We take the out degree.

776
00:30:10,801 --> 00:30:13,000
We divide your page rank
by the out degree.

777
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,434
And page rank
more or less flows

778
00:30:14,434 --> 00:30:17,167
in that proportion
to all those pages.

779
00:30:17,167 --> 00:30:19,501
So the closer you are
to the root page

780
00:30:19,501 --> 00:30:20,801
in terms of links,

781
00:30:20,801 --> 00:30:23,367
the more page rank
your page will have.

782
00:30:23,367 --> 00:30:27,033
So if you have to clink
17 links to find, you know,

783
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:28,534
a particular page,

784
00:30:28,534 --> 00:30:31,133
that means Googlebot
has to click 17 links

785
00:30:31,133 --> 00:30:32,767
to get to that particular page.

786
00:30:32,767 --> 00:30:35,000
So the amount of page rank
will be much, much less.

787
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,133
That's why you should think

788
00:30:36,133 --> 00:30:38,567
about putting
your most important stuff

789
00:30:38,567 --> 00:30:40,100
relatively close to the root.

790
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,734
Now, I'm talking
in a virtual sense.

791
00:30:41,734 --> 00:30:42,868
Imagine if you click one link,

792
00:30:42,868 --> 00:30:45,734
and it gets you three
directories deep.

793
00:30:45,734 --> 00:30:47,934
Is that a problem?

794
00:30:47,934 --> 00:30:49,100
On Google, it's not.

795
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,868
We only look at,
"Oh, there was one link,

796
00:30:50,868 --> 00:30:52,734
"and it went, you know,
three directories deep

797
00:30:52,734 --> 00:30:54,033
within the site."

798
00:30:54,033 --> 00:30:56,000
That's totally fine.
It's just one link.

799
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,801
There are some search engines
who probably look

800
00:30:57,801 --> 00:31:01,067
at the number of depth
of the directory.

801
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:03,200
So if you can make it
relatively close to the root

802
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,667
on the number--
the number of subdirectories,

803
00:31:05,667 --> 00:31:07,000
that's not
a bad practice either.

804
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,601
Then you might do
a little bit better on Yahoo!

805
00:31:08,601 --> 00:31:10,400
You might do a little bit better
on Microsoft.

806
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,868
But on Google, you don't need
to worry about that.

807
00:31:12,868 --> 00:31:14,734
So the question, pulling back,

808
00:31:14,734 --> 00:31:16,767
is, should I put nofollow
on one of these links?

809
00:31:16,767 --> 00:31:18,934
No.
Let all the page rank flow.

810
00:31:18,934 --> 00:31:21,033
The only rank time
I'd really use nofollow

811
00:31:21,033 --> 00:31:22,601
on your own internal links

812
00:31:22,601 --> 00:31:24,767
where you say,
"No, don't flow any page rank,"

813
00:31:24,767 --> 00:31:26,801
is maybe a login page, right?

814
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,067
Think about Expedia.

815
00:31:28,067 --> 00:31:30,400
If I go to Expedia
and there's a login page,

816
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,000
what good is it if Googlebot
crawls that login page?

817
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,667
We don't have a credit card.

818
00:31:35,667 --> 00:31:38,067
Googlebot's not going to fly
to Vegas for the weekend.

819
00:31:38,067 --> 00:31:39,901
So you don't need us
to, you know, go and visit

820
00:31:39,901 --> 00:31:41,167
your login page.

821
00:31:41,167 --> 00:31:42,767
So that would be a good one
to put nofollow on.

822
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:44,267
Don't--Don't bother to waste
the page rank

823
00:31:44,267 --> 00:31:48,033
on, you know, uh, that sort
of stuff happening.

824
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:51,234
Mm-hmm.
Tell you what...

825
00:31:51,234 --> 00:31:53,701
maybe--maybe take it offline
and catch it after.

826
00:31:53,701 --> 00:31:58,434
Okay, now we reach the very
active participation part.

827
00:31:58,434 --> 00:32:01,801
I want everybody
to close your eyes.

828
00:32:01,801 --> 00:32:04,267
I still see open eyes.
No, seriously, close your eyes.

829
00:32:04,267 --> 00:32:05,801
Close your eyes.

830
00:32:05,801 --> 00:32:07,801
While I have your eyes closed,
I'm going to bring up a site.

831
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:09,667
Keep your eyes closed.

832
00:32:09,667 --> 00:32:12,868
Okay, open your eyes.
Snap judgment.

833
00:32:12,868 --> 00:32:15,901
What's this site about?

834
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:18,367
What does this site do?

835
00:32:18,367 --> 00:32:20,200
No idea.
Closebys.

836
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,801
"Closeby services
meet Close friends

837
00:32:21,801 --> 00:32:23,534
to share the small things."

838
00:32:23,534 --> 00:32:25,601
What the heck does that mean?

839
00:32:25,601 --> 00:32:28,400
I have no idea.
Okay, well, let's dig deeper.

840
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:32,267
"3 cents to 10 cents/ACElet
upto $110/year."

841
00:32:32,267 --> 00:32:35,767
What does that mean?
I have no idea.

842
00:32:35,767 --> 00:32:38,968
Okay. Um, "Everyone qualifies
for 3 cents."

843
00:32:38,968 --> 00:32:41,400
Yes! I've made 3 cents.
What does that mean?

844
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,334
I have no idea.

845
00:32:43,334 --> 00:32:44,667
Okay, so let's start
digging deeper.

846
00:32:44,667 --> 00:32:46,601
Let's start clicking around
within the site.

847
00:32:46,601 --> 00:32:51,734
"Hair Salons. Auto.
Maintenance. Home."

848
00:32:51,734 --> 00:32:53,567
Now, if you're looking
in the bottom left,

849
00:32:53,567 --> 00:32:56,567
every single one of them
leads to the same URL.

850
00:32:56,567 --> 00:32:59,701
They all lead
to closebys.com/services.

851
00:32:59,701 --> 00:33:02,067
Okay, so I'm getting
confused here.

852
00:33:02,067 --> 00:33:05,067
"Maintenance.
Health & Fitness. Travel."

853
00:33:05,067 --> 00:33:08,033
Okay, let's click on Travel.

854
00:33:08,033 --> 00:33:10,133
If someone can't land
on your site

855
00:33:10,133 --> 00:33:13,467
and know what it's about
in a second or two,

856
00:33:13,467 --> 00:33:15,701
you've lost probably half
your buyers

857
00:33:15,701 --> 00:33:17,968
or half of your conversions

858
00:33:17,968 --> 00:33:21,334
or half of whatever it is you're
trying to optimize, right?

859
00:33:21,334 --> 00:33:23,667
So this is a good example
where you get that person,

860
00:33:23,667 --> 00:33:25,667
and you say,
"Okay, I will give you $20

861
00:33:25,667 --> 00:33:26,701
to use my site."

862
00:33:26,701 --> 00:33:28,367
And probably
the first five people

863
00:33:28,367 --> 00:33:32,501
to use that site are like,
"What--What is it?", right?

864
00:33:32,501 --> 00:33:37,267
Oh, we sell ACElets.
What are ACElets?

865
00:33:37,267 --> 00:33:39,501
ACE is an announcement,
coupon, or event

866
00:33:39,501 --> 00:33:41,534
sent to you
by your local business.

867
00:33:41,534 --> 00:33:43,400
Okay, so now we start
to get to it.

868
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,133
You register for ACElets,

869
00:33:45,133 --> 00:33:46,901
and then you can get these sort
of offers sent to you,

870
00:33:46,901 --> 00:33:48,567
and they can be coupons.

871
00:33:48,567 --> 00:33:50,634
So that can be pretty useful.

872
00:33:50,634 --> 00:33:52,901
Um...

873
00:33:52,901 --> 00:33:55,601
start to look
into it a little bit more.

874
00:33:55,601 --> 00:33:57,934
Services pay per customer.

875
00:33:57,934 --> 00:34:00,801
It's a little bit
opaque, right?

876
00:34:00,801 --> 00:34:02,901
What does Closebysocial

877
00:34:02,901 --> 00:34:06,400
have to do with businesses
allocated, right?

878
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,400
And so this is another one
where you want to sort of think

879
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,167
about the fit and finish
of your site.

880
00:34:11,167 --> 00:34:14,701
I-I--We were doing
a practice session at Google.

881
00:34:14,701 --> 00:34:16,667
And I was saying,
"Okay, close your eyes.

882
00:34:16,667 --> 00:34:18,634
Open your eyes.
And what does this site do?"

883
00:34:18,634 --> 00:34:20,868
And somebody was, like,
"They sell guns!"

884
00:34:20,868 --> 00:34:23,267
"What?
Why do they sell guns?"

885
00:34:23,267 --> 00:34:25,467
"'Cause there's an NRA show."

886
00:34:25,467 --> 00:34:28,300
"NRA. Maybe the--
Oh, that's the restaurant.

887
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,467
Okay."

888
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:30,601
They seriously thought,

889
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:32,267
and I seriously thought
until I moused over it,

890
00:34:32,267 --> 00:34:34,834
that this was
about selling guns, right?

891
00:34:34,834 --> 00:34:38,133
So think about the overall fit
and finish.

892
00:34:38,133 --> 00:34:40,634
Um, and here's
a simple example.

893
00:34:40,634 --> 00:34:45,434
"Upto" is two words, right?

894
00:34:45,434 --> 00:34:47,267
That's like the fifth word
that you see

895
00:34:47,267 --> 00:34:49,000
whenever you start
reading the page.

896
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,567
So think
about the little things.

897
00:34:50,567 --> 00:34:51,968
Think about
the fit and finish.

898
00:34:51,968 --> 00:34:54,367
Think about--There's actually
a pixel missing here,

899
00:34:54,367 --> 00:34:56,434
which you might
or might not be able to see.

900
00:34:56,434 --> 00:34:59,467
And so how--how professional
do these things look?

901
00:34:59,467 --> 00:35:01,534
Um, as you click around,

902
00:35:01,534 --> 00:35:03,667
it's actually
kind of an interesting idea.

903
00:35:03,667 --> 00:35:05,000
If someone wants to save money,

904
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,601
they can sign up
and get these announcements,

905
00:35:07,601 --> 00:35:09,968
coupons, and events,
stuff like that.

906
00:35:09,968 --> 00:35:11,634
So it can be pretty handy.

907
00:35:11,634 --> 00:35:13,400
But you're not doing
a very good job

908
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,534
of communicating it to people.

909
00:35:15,534 --> 00:35:17,067
Now, I've--I've been
a little sarcastic.

910
00:35:17,067 --> 00:35:18,067
I've been a little mean.

911
00:35:18,067 --> 00:35:19,667
So what's good about this site?

912
00:35:19,667 --> 00:35:22,734
Anybody want to chime in?
What do they think?

913
00:35:24,334 --> 00:35:26,434
You won't--You won't fall asleep
looking at it.

914
00:35:26,434 --> 00:35:27,534
That's true.

915
00:35:27,534 --> 00:35:29,200
It looks a little
like a MySpace page.

916
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,601
Got the glitter.

917
00:35:30,601 --> 00:35:33,133
You know, that would sort of
complete the look a little bit.

918
00:35:33,133 --> 00:35:36,501
Um, I think this
is kind of interesting too.

919
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:41,000
This is a banner ad on Closebys
for Closeby services.

920
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,868
And if you click on it,
you go back to Closebys, right?

921
00:35:44,868 --> 00:35:46,033
Fit and finish.

922
00:35:46,033 --> 00:35:47,634
It's not all
about search engines.

923
00:35:47,634 --> 00:35:50,400
It's also about your users.
It's also about your visitors.

924
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,701
Now, it's not completely
the same URL.

925
00:35:53,701 --> 00:35:55,033
In fact, if you look at it,

926
00:35:55,033 --> 00:35:58,634
it's actually
closebys/index.html.

927
00:35:58,634 --> 00:36:00,868
And that brings me to a topic
that I wanted to mention.

928
00:36:00,868 --> 00:36:03,667
You would be amazed
how many people

929
00:36:03,667 --> 00:36:08,701
have got
closebys.com/index.html,

930
00:36:08,701 --> 00:36:13,400
index.php, noindex.html,
www.closebys,

931
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,033
non-www closebys.

932
00:36:16,033 --> 00:36:18,634
So one of the big pieces
of advice that I give

933
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:22,534
is look at the internal linking
on your site and be consistent.

934
00:36:22,534 --> 00:36:25,100
You would be amazed--
literally amazed--

935
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:28,934
at how many sites have a www
and a non-www version

936
00:36:28,934 --> 00:36:30,200
of their Website.

937
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,968
Now, why would that matter
to you?

938
00:36:31,968 --> 00:36:34,033
Greg, Brian, why would it be
a bad thing

939
00:36:34,033 --> 00:36:37,200
if I had two different versions
of my Web page?

940
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,601
Grothaus: Well, one--
for one reason,

941
00:36:38,601 --> 00:36:40,934
if people are going
to your Website,

942
00:36:40,934 --> 00:36:42,567
uh, they'll go to one page
or the other.

943
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:44,133
And as a result,
they'll--they're sharing

944
00:36:44,133 --> 00:36:45,400
that Website
with their friends.

945
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,667
They'll send you one
or the other.

946
00:36:46,667 --> 00:36:47,834
And all of your links
on the Web

947
00:36:47,834 --> 00:36:49,133
will end up being split

948
00:36:49,133 --> 00:36:51,234
between those two different
versions of the site.

949
00:36:51,234 --> 00:36:52,767
Uh, Google's pretty good
at noticing this.

950
00:36:52,767 --> 00:36:55,000
But sometimes when we see
that maybe these two pages

951
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,300
look different,
maybe we'll crawl one version

952
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,934
and crawl another version
at a different time.

953
00:36:58,934 --> 00:37:00,834
And you have changed your site
dramatically in between them.

954
00:37:00,834 --> 00:37:02,901
And so we're a little--We can
get a little bit confused.

955
00:37:02,901 --> 00:37:04,734
Are these the same page,
or are they not?

956
00:37:04,734 --> 00:37:06,234
And maybe we'll split
your link juice

957
00:37:06,234 --> 00:37:07,734
between the two pages
and not give you full credit

958
00:37:07,734 --> 00:37:09,701
for all your links
to one single site,

959
00:37:09,701 --> 00:37:11,100
which is what
you really want.

960
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,367
Cutts: Absolutely.
We normally do a good job.

961
00:37:13,367 --> 00:37:15,467
We normally can say
these are the same.

962
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:17,834
But imagine if this
is a dynamic page, right?

963
00:37:17,834 --> 00:37:19,501
What if right up
at the top of the page,

964
00:37:19,501 --> 00:37:22,501
you say "the current date is"
with a time stamp?

965
00:37:22,501 --> 00:37:24,534
And then we visit
www and non-www,

966
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:26,133
and the pages look
a little different.

967
00:37:26,133 --> 00:37:29,601
We might not correctly
glom those together.

968
00:37:29,601 --> 00:37:32,868
So I've actually seen
a www have a page rank 6

969
00:37:32,868 --> 00:37:35,467
and a non-www of the page
have a page rank 4.

970
00:37:35,467 --> 00:37:36,934
So they're splitting
their page rank

971
00:37:36,934 --> 00:37:38,400
in between those pages.

972
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,901
Whenever you can,
it's really nice

973
00:37:39,901 --> 00:37:42,000
if you can kind of unify them
and bring them together

974
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,501
a little bit.

975
00:37:43,501 --> 00:37:44,901
Questions about that?

976
00:37:44,901 --> 00:37:47,734
Yeah.

977
00:37:47,734 --> 00:37:49,000
Oh, speak up.
Shout it out.

978
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,434
White: Can you go
to the mic, perhaps?

979
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,367
Cutts: In fact, come to the--
come to the microphone.

980
00:37:52,367 --> 00:37:54,400
Guy's like, "I didn't want
to be embarrassed like this.

981
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,300
Come on."

982
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,567
man:
Um, does it help to have,

983
00:37:57,567 --> 00:37:59,901
like, a redirecting,
uh, application

984
00:37:59,901 --> 00:38:02,000
or something like that
for those type of domains?

985
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,968
Like, doing 301 redirects
or something?

986
00:38:03,968 --> 00:38:05,300
Cutts:
Yeah, absolutely.

987
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:08,801
Um, it helps to have 301s
internally and externally.

988
00:38:08,801 --> 00:38:11,968
So Google
is a very large Website.

989
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:13,934
A lot of people come to Google.

990
00:38:13,934 --> 00:38:16,000
And so a lot of people
register domains

991
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,868
that sound like Google
or variants of Google.

992
00:38:18,868 --> 00:38:21,901
For example, porngoogle,

993
00:38:21,901 --> 00:38:24,100
googlesex,

994
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,934
googlingfordollars, right?

995
00:38:25,934 --> 00:38:28,467
All these people, they are like,
"Oh, I'm going to make money

996
00:38:28,467 --> 00:38:29,801
off the Google
domain name," right?

997
00:38:29,801 --> 00:38:31,567
And so they register
something something Google.

998
00:38:31,567 --> 00:38:32,634
And then we have to go
and say,

999
00:38:32,634 --> 00:38:34,200
"Hey, you didn't invent
the word Google.

1000
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,868
"Can we have googleporn
or googlesex or whatever back?"

1001
00:38:36,868 --> 00:38:38,667
And they're like, "Okay, fine.
Here you go."

1002
00:38:38,667 --> 00:38:40,634
Now we have this domain,
googlesex.com.

1003
00:38:40,634 --> 00:38:42,100
What are we going to do
with that?

1004
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:45,100
We're not going to have
an unsafe version of Google

1005
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,601
that's, like, only porn, right?

1006
00:38:47,601 --> 00:38:49,000
Matt's house of porn.

1007
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,133
Do all your searches here
and get all the sort of weird,

1008
00:38:51,133 --> 00:38:52,133
fetish stuff you want.

1009
00:38:52,133 --> 00:38:54,200
We're not going to do that.

1010
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,334
So what we do instead
is we do a 301 redirect.

1011
00:38:57,334 --> 00:38:59,100
And that's
a permanent redirect.

1012
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:02,067
And 301 just refers
to the HTTP status code.

1013
00:39:02,067 --> 00:39:04,400
You can pretend to be a browser
using Telnet.

1014
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,400
So if you Telnet to port 80
and say, "Get slash,"

1015
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,968
that's saying,
"Give me the root of this page

1016
00:39:08,968 --> 00:39:10,534
on your Web server."

1017
00:39:10,534 --> 00:39:13,400
And the--the response code
is 200, okay,

1018
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,868
if it's a normal page.

1019
00:39:14,868 --> 00:39:17,501
If it's moved,
it's usual 3-something.

1020
00:39:17,501 --> 00:39:21,801
If it's 301, it's permanent.
If it's 302, it's temporary.

1021
00:39:21,801 --> 00:39:23,968
So imagine that you've just
moved your Website

1022
00:39:23,968 --> 00:39:25,901
for, you know, a few weeks.

1023
00:39:25,901 --> 00:39:27,667
That's the perfect time
to use a 302,

1024
00:39:27,667 --> 00:39:29,400
if you're going to be coming
back to it.

1025
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,501
Um, a lot of people
who do banner ads

1026
00:39:31,501 --> 00:39:33,334
will do 302s,
things like that.

1027
00:39:33,334 --> 00:39:34,701
But if you have moved
your site--

1028
00:39:34,701 --> 00:39:38,400
if you have truly moved it
from sitea.com to siteb.com

1029
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,300
and you're never planning
on going back,

1030
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,434
that's when you can use a 301.

1031
00:39:42,434 --> 00:39:44,734
And then all the page rank
flows, and everybody's happy,

1032
00:39:44,734 --> 00:39:46,834
and your rankings are preserved
and all that sort of stuff.

1033
00:39:46,834 --> 00:39:48,334
And you can do an internal 301.

1034
00:39:48,334 --> 00:39:50,267
That means if you go
to the non-www,

1035
00:39:50,267 --> 00:39:52,167
you get a 301 to the www.

1036
00:39:52,167 --> 00:39:53,167
So that's really nice.

1037
00:39:53,167 --> 00:39:54,400
You're not linking to it.

1038
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,434
You're just--voosh--immediately
taken in there.

1039
00:39:56,434 --> 00:39:58,033
And a lot of sites
like Slashdot.

1040
00:39:58,033 --> 00:39:59,501
If you go to www.slashdot,

1041
00:39:59,501 --> 00:40:01,567
it'll probably redirect you
to just slashdot.

1042
00:40:01,567 --> 00:40:02,734
And that's pretty smart.

1043
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:04,801
Then people
can't really get mixed up.

1044
00:40:04,801 --> 00:40:06,901
If you try to link to it
and you visit it,

1045
00:40:06,901 --> 00:40:08,567
you'll get redirected
to the non-www

1046
00:40:08,567 --> 00:40:10,734
and then you end up usually
linking to the non-www.

1047
00:40:10,734 --> 00:40:11,901
So that's a great way
to take care

1048
00:40:11,901 --> 00:40:13,667
of those
sort of duplicate issues.

1049
00:40:13,667 --> 00:40:15,167
White: I'll add to that too.
Cutts: Yeah.

1050
00:40:15,167 --> 00:40:16,901
White: A number of Web hosts
have already taken care

1051
00:40:16,901 --> 00:40:17,901
of that for you.

1052
00:40:17,901 --> 00:40:19,968
On my Web host, um, I found

1053
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:22,968
that when I typed
a non-www-version domain name,

1054
00:40:22,968 --> 00:40:25,100
it automatically
redirected over or vice versa.

1055
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,501
So that's sometimes
taken care of for you.

1056
00:40:27,501 --> 00:40:30,968
I want to make a plug, too,
for Live HTTP Headers extension

1057
00:40:30,968 --> 00:40:32,033
in Firefox.

1058
00:40:32,033 --> 00:40:33,701
Does anyone use that?
Raise your hand.

1059
00:40:33,701 --> 00:40:35,701
Yeah. That's a--
That's a nice one.

1060
00:40:35,701 --> 00:40:38,567
Briefly, it lets you see
the requests and the responses

1061
00:40:38,567 --> 00:40:40,767
between the browser
and the server.

1062
00:40:40,767 --> 00:40:43,067
In--In effect,
you are kind of--

1063
00:40:43,067 --> 00:40:44,734
I don't know
a better way to say it--

1064
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:46,501
but wiretapping
your own, uh, connection

1065
00:40:46,501 --> 00:40:47,767
between the servers.

1066
00:40:47,767 --> 00:40:50,000
So you can actually see,
um, what the response codes

1067
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,067
that come through.

1068
00:40:51,067 --> 00:40:52,501
You can do--
Use Matt's version.

1069
00:40:52,501 --> 00:40:54,000
Telnet. You can use
Live HTTP Headers

1070
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,701
and make sure
that 301 is happening

1071
00:40:55,701 --> 00:40:58,667
from www to non-www
or vice versa.

1072
00:40:58,667 --> 00:41:00,467
So, yeah, that's something
you can add.

1073
00:41:00,467 --> 00:41:01,868
Cutts: It's a really
useful tool.

1074
00:41:01,868 --> 00:41:04,000
You would be amazed
at how many sites

1075
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,601
return very strange stuff,
um, you know, in the headers.

1076
00:41:07,601 --> 00:41:09,734
And so if you're looking at
those headers, you're realizing,

1077
00:41:09,734 --> 00:41:11,234
"Oh, something strange
is going on."

1078
00:41:11,234 --> 00:41:12,667
And you can do it yourself.

1079
00:41:12,667 --> 00:41:14,734
You can go down to the wire
and Telnet and all that stuff.

1080
00:41:14,734 --> 00:41:16,567
But it's much easier
if it's just a Firefox add-on.

1081
00:41:16,567 --> 00:41:17,734
So it's a lot of fun.

1082
00:41:17,734 --> 00:41:19,901
One more plug,
and I don't want to--

1083
00:41:19,901 --> 00:41:22,234
We are at a Google conference,
so I don't want to be, you know,

1084
00:41:22,234 --> 00:41:25,567
too salesy, but there's
google.com/webmasters.

1085
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:26,901
That's the Webmaster console.

1086
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:29,000
If you haven't registered,

1087
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,701
it's not negligence
if you don't use it,

1088
00:41:30,701 --> 00:41:33,434
but it's a really, really,
really useful tool.

1089
00:41:33,434 --> 00:41:36,501
For example, if you say,
"Okay, I own mattcutts.com,"

1090
00:41:36,501 --> 00:41:38,734
we have an option
where you can say,

1091
00:41:38,734 --> 00:41:42,334
"What's my preference,
www.mattcutts.com or non-www?"

1092
00:41:42,334 --> 00:41:44,267
We also show you errors
that we found

1093
00:41:44,267 --> 00:41:45,801
when Googlebot crawled.

1094
00:41:45,801 --> 00:41:48,133
We even showed you
how long the latency is

1095
00:41:48,133 --> 00:41:50,801
for Google to fetch pages
from your site.

1096
00:41:50,801 --> 00:41:52,334
So if you're having
server issues,

1097
00:41:52,334 --> 00:41:53,901
you can sometimes
diagnose it.

1098
00:41:53,901 --> 00:41:56,367
So we'll show you all kinds
of really useful information.

1099
00:41:56,367 --> 00:41:58,901
And the ability to set
that sort of www or non-www

1100
00:41:58,901 --> 00:42:00,901
is very helpful
in that kind of case.

1101
00:42:00,901 --> 00:42:02,634
Question. Yeah.
At the microphone, yeah.

1102
00:42:02,634 --> 00:42:05,367
man: Um, yeah,
the, um, question before

1103
00:42:05,367 --> 00:42:07,000
about variants in--

1104
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,033
Um, for example,
I use Analytics extensively.

1105
00:42:10,033 --> 00:42:11,267
Cutts: Mm-hmm.

1106
00:42:11,267 --> 00:42:13,334
man: And I'll get a return
for the URL--

1107
00:42:13,334 --> 00:42:17,868
the URL plus, uh, index.htm--

1108
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,300
um, several variants.

1109
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,200
And I don't think
that's a question--

1110
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,467
I think I'm consistent
within the Website.

1111
00:42:23,467 --> 00:42:24,601
Cutts: Mm-hmm.

1112
00:42:24,601 --> 00:42:27,267
man: But, um,
which kind of contradicts

1113
00:42:27,267 --> 00:42:28,901
what you just said.

1114
00:42:28,901 --> 00:42:30,901
Cutts: Oh, no, you always
want to be consistent

1115
00:42:30,901 --> 00:42:32,067
if you can.

1116
00:42:32,067 --> 00:42:35,033
man: Yeah, but I mean,
those external accesses,

1117
00:42:35,033 --> 00:42:39,567
how did they, um, decide,
you know,

1118
00:42:39,567 --> 00:42:42,534
to access my Website when
I was consistent internally,

1119
00:42:42,534 --> 00:42:43,734
I guess, is the question.

1120
00:42:43,734 --> 00:42:45,334
Cutts:
So most of the time,

1121
00:42:45,334 --> 00:42:47,434
it's just people
are not that skilled.

1122
00:42:47,434 --> 00:42:49,734
Like, they're going to link
to Slashdot,

1123
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:52,167
and so they just assume
it's www.slashdot,

1124
00:42:52,167 --> 00:42:55,000
even though Slashdot
wanted to be without the www.

1125
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,567
So a lot of the times,
if people--

1126
00:42:56,567 --> 00:42:58,000
You would be amazed
at how many people

1127
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,067
will link to you
with broken stuff.

1128
00:43:00,067 --> 00:43:02,734
In fact, you know, to plug
the Google Webmaster console,

1129
00:43:02,734 --> 00:43:05,000
we will show you
all the backlinks to your site.

1130
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,934
And we'll also show you
all the 404s on your site.

1131
00:43:07,934 --> 00:43:10,067
So one of the best tips
that I always give is,

1132
00:43:10,067 --> 00:43:11,801
if you would like free links--

1133
00:43:11,801 --> 00:43:14,534
and most people on the Web
would like free links--

1134
00:43:14,534 --> 00:43:16,267
you can go to this tool
and you can say,

1135
00:43:16,267 --> 00:43:18,767
"Who are the people
who link to 404 pages?"

1136
00:43:18,767 --> 00:43:20,400
And they're going to be
very reputable people.

1137
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,901
There was, uh--
ZDNet had linked to my site,

1138
00:43:22,901 --> 00:43:24,868
and they'd linked to a page
that didn't exist

1139
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:26,901
with, like,
two trailing slashes.

1140
00:43:26,901 --> 00:43:28,267
And so if you contact
that reporter

1141
00:43:28,267 --> 00:43:30,267
and you say, "Hey, uh, you know,
double slashes

1142
00:43:30,267 --> 00:43:33,300
on the Internet are weird,
just link to the normal page,"

1143
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,567
hey, free link.

1144
00:43:34,567 --> 00:43:37,133
Now it's not a 404 page.
It links right to me.

1145
00:43:37,133 --> 00:43:39,868
The fact is, anybody can link
to anybody else on the Web.

1146
00:43:39,868 --> 00:43:43,067
So we don't penalize people
if a spammer links to you.

1147
00:43:43,067 --> 00:43:44,801
The nice thing is,
if someone links to you

1148
00:43:44,801 --> 00:43:46,234
that you normally link to
correctly,

1149
00:43:46,234 --> 00:43:48,200
but they don't always
link to you correctly,

1150
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,968
by being consistent
with your internal linking,

1151
00:43:49,968 --> 00:43:51,100
you try to prevent

1152
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:53,634
at least the worst of stuff
from happening.

1153
00:43:53,634 --> 00:43:55,868
Good question.
Yeah. Another question.

1154
00:43:55,868 --> 00:43:58,934
woman: Um, we, uh, work
at the University of California,

1155
00:43:58,934 --> 00:44:00,968
and we're not allowed
to use some Google tools

1156
00:44:00,968 --> 00:44:03,200
because of an indemnity clause.

1157
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,133
And I'm wondering
if there's an indemnity clause

1158
00:44:05,133 --> 00:44:07,334
associated
with the Webmasters.

1159
00:44:07,334 --> 00:44:09,400
Cutts: Uh, that's
an excellent question.

1160
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,267
Catch me and get
my contact info afterwards,

1161
00:44:11,267 --> 00:44:13,100
and I'll--I'll try
and look it up for you.

1162
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:14,868
Yeah, this is one thing
that, um--

1163
00:44:14,868 --> 00:44:17,200
I talk to a lot of government
Webmasters, right?

1164
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,567
'Cause they're like,
"Okay, we would like to find out

1165
00:44:19,567 --> 00:44:21,667
"what the broken links are
on our site,

1166
00:44:21,667 --> 00:44:24,801
but, you know, bureaucracy
can get a little overwhelming."

1167
00:44:24,801 --> 00:44:27,234
And so sometimes people
literally just go rogue.

1168
00:44:27,234 --> 00:44:28,667
They're like,
"I'm just going to prove

1169
00:44:28,667 --> 00:44:29,767
"that I own this Website.

1170
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:31,100
"I'm going to edit
this meta tag.

1171
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:32,167
"No one needs to know.

1172
00:44:32,167 --> 00:44:33,434
"Okay, now I'll log out.

1173
00:44:33,434 --> 00:44:34,968
And I have
the information I need."

1174
00:44:34,968 --> 00:44:37,067
And I'm not condoning that.
I'm not sanctioning that.

1175
00:44:37,067 --> 00:44:39,868
I'm just saying a lot of people,
turns out, they do that.

1176
00:44:39,868 --> 00:44:41,934
Uh, but everybody has different,
you know, restrictions

1177
00:44:41,934 --> 00:44:44,400
on when they are
or aren't allowed to do it.

1178
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,834
Um, I'll have to check
on whether we have some sort

1179
00:44:46,834 --> 00:44:48,968
of indemnity clause
on--on Webmaster central.

1180
00:44:48,968 --> 00:44:50,868
Good question.
Another question. Yeah.

1181
00:44:50,868 --> 00:44:53,901
man: Hi. Um, interesting
that you're from Omaha.

1182
00:44:53,901 --> 00:44:57,167
We just, uh--we sold our company
a couple of years ago, NetShops.

1183
00:44:57,167 --> 00:45:00,234
Um, and because
of non-competes,

1184
00:45:00,234 --> 00:45:03,868
we--we really couldn't sell
much of anything online.

1185
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:06,501
So we started
that racy.com site.

1186
00:45:06,501 --> 00:45:08,767
And I understand
why you didn't put it up.

1187
00:45:08,767 --> 00:45:11,167
But I-I'm very, very curious,

1188
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:15,634
are we starting from a hole
because we're trying to--

1189
00:45:15,634 --> 00:45:18,501
Uh, it's not pornographic,
but it's on the edge.

1190
00:45:18,501 --> 00:45:21,200
And I'm just wondering
what, uh--what the take--

1191
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,667
is it--is they're also history
of the domain name

1192
00:45:23,667 --> 00:45:25,467
that is bringing
along problems?

1193
00:45:25,467 --> 00:45:28,634
And how, uh--
how can we resolve--

1194
00:45:28,634 --> 00:45:30,901
What--What should we do
in this situation?

1195
00:45:30,901 --> 00:45:32,334
Cutts: Absolutely.
Very fun question.

1196
00:45:32,334 --> 00:45:34,234
So we took a bunch
of submissions.

1197
00:45:34,234 --> 00:45:37,567
Um, one of the submissions
was racy.com,

1198
00:45:37,567 --> 00:45:39,234
which I have no problem with.

1199
00:45:39,234 --> 00:45:40,234
I put it up, you know,

1200
00:45:40,234 --> 00:45:41,601
in our internal
training session.

1201
00:45:41,601 --> 00:45:42,701
We were looking at it.

1202
00:45:42,701 --> 00:45:44,701
There's some
pretty explicit stuff.

1203
00:45:44,701 --> 00:45:47,000
In fact, last night
I was trying to find some part

1204
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,501
of the site that would be safe,
you know, to project.

1205
00:45:50,501 --> 00:45:52,434
And I was like,
"This is a little--"

1206
00:45:52,434 --> 00:45:53,601
It's not radioactive.

1207
00:45:53,601 --> 00:45:54,868
It's just, like,
there will always be

1208
00:45:54,868 --> 00:45:56,133
a couple objectionable words,

1209
00:45:56,133 --> 00:45:58,000
so I decided to not put it up
on the projector.

1210
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,734
Uh, but as I recall,
you had good URL structure.

1211
00:46:00,734 --> 00:46:03,367
So let me turn that
into a more general question.

1212
00:46:03,367 --> 00:46:04,734
I just bought a domain,

1213
00:46:04,734 --> 00:46:06,567
and I'm worried
the previous owner might've done

1214
00:46:06,567 --> 00:46:08,334
something unsavory with it.

1215
00:46:08,334 --> 00:46:10,234
It turns out, in your case,
that didn't happen.

1216
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:11,334
But here's what you can do,

1217
00:46:11,334 --> 00:46:15,367
go to archive.org
and look at www.racy.com

1218
00:46:15,367 --> 00:46:17,701
or example.com
or whatever your site is

1219
00:46:17,701 --> 00:46:19,267
over history.

1220
00:46:19,267 --> 00:46:21,267
In fact, if you're thinking
about buying a domain name--

1221
00:46:21,267 --> 00:46:23,033
and we have seen people
buy domain names

1222
00:46:23,033 --> 00:46:25,234
where a spammer took it,

1223
00:46:25,234 --> 00:46:28,167
and they burned it
to the ground, right?

1224
00:46:28,167 --> 00:46:30,067
They just did everything.
They spammed--

1225
00:46:30,067 --> 00:46:32,567
You remember the, uh...

1226
00:46:32,567 --> 00:46:36,067
this--this--this guy--

1227
00:46:36,067 --> 00:46:38,000
Where's my spammer?
There's my spammer.

1228
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Blogsense.biz.

1229
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,434
A lot of the times,
people will buy this domain,

1230
00:46:42,434 --> 00:46:45,767
spam the hell out of it,
do as much stuff as they can,

1231
00:46:45,767 --> 00:46:47,200
and as soon
as all the search engines

1232
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,267
have caught them and, like,
deconstructed their spam house

1233
00:46:50,267 --> 00:46:52,133
brick by brick
and buried the bricks

1234
00:46:52,133 --> 00:46:53,934
in different places
and then salted the ground

1235
00:46:53,934 --> 00:46:56,868
so that this domain
does not rank well, right?

1236
00:46:56,868 --> 00:46:59,434
Then they try to sell
the domain, right?

1237
00:46:59,434 --> 00:47:01,934
And a lot of the times, if your
traffic is going like this

1238
00:47:01,934 --> 00:47:03,467
and then the search engines
find your spam

1239
00:47:03,467 --> 00:47:04,934
and it goes like this,

1240
00:47:04,934 --> 00:47:07,734
they'll take a picture
when the traffic was like this.

1241
00:47:07,734 --> 00:47:09,868
And they'll be like, "Oh, yeah,
look at our rankings.

1242
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:11,334
They're really climbing."

1243
00:47:11,334 --> 00:47:14,868
So the way to protect yourself
against that is a couple things.

1244
00:47:14,868 --> 00:47:16,601
Go to archive.org and search,

1245
00:47:16,601 --> 00:47:18,400
and you can see the historical
amount of information

1246
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,534
about the domain.

1247
00:47:19,534 --> 00:47:20,834
You can see
what the domain looked like

1248
00:47:20,834 --> 00:47:22,100
three years ago
or four years ago

1249
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:23,367
or five years ago.

1250
00:47:23,367 --> 00:47:26,067
The other thing is,
just do a search for the domain.

1251
00:47:26,067 --> 00:47:30,767
I think I can do a search
for racy.com,

1252
00:47:30,767 --> 00:47:33,734
um...

1253
00:47:33,734 --> 00:47:36,367
as a phrase, right?

1254
00:47:36,367 --> 00:47:37,834
So racy.com
is right at number one.

1255
00:47:37,834 --> 00:47:39,100
That's a good sign.

1256
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:41,133
And you'll notice
now you have dictionaries,

1257
00:47:41,133 --> 00:47:42,567
that sort of stuff.

1258
00:47:42,567 --> 00:47:45,300
If what you see is people
complaining about your site,

1259
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:47,567
people saying,
"Oh, I can't believe racy.com.

1260
00:47:47,567 --> 00:47:49,567
Those guys are spammers,"
or something like that,

1261
00:47:49,567 --> 00:47:50,934
then I would be worried.

1262
00:47:50,934 --> 00:47:52,601
But in fact, I don't think
that you necessarily

1263
00:47:52,601 --> 00:47:54,367
have any issue with the previous
owners having issues

1264
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:55,400
or something like that.

1265
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,567
Feel free to catch me
afterwards,

1266
00:47:56,567 --> 00:47:58,868
and we can talk
about it more then.

1267
00:47:58,868 --> 00:48:00,701
Okay, more questions
from the audience?

1268
00:48:00,701 --> 00:48:02,434
Yeah, come on up to the mic.

1269
00:48:02,434 --> 00:48:05,067
I'm figuring you guys prefer
a little more interactivity,

1270
00:48:05,067 --> 00:48:06,167
but I'm pretty--

1271
00:48:06,167 --> 00:48:08,234
man: I have two questions.
Cutts: Cool.

1272
00:48:08,234 --> 00:48:11,767
man: Do you treat 500 responses
different from 502s?

1273
00:48:11,767 --> 00:48:13,567
Cutts: Mm-hmm.

1274
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:17,634
man: The second one
is, um, images.

1275
00:48:17,634 --> 00:48:19,567
Do you guy--
How--how would a--

1276
00:48:19,567 --> 00:48:21,534
Let's say we have
a thumbnail version,

1277
00:48:21,534 --> 00:48:23,067
and we have a full version.

1278
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:25,701
And we prefer you index
the full version,

1279
00:48:25,701 --> 00:48:26,968
but we're only showing
the thumbnail

1280
00:48:26,968 --> 00:48:28,701
on a particular article.

1281
00:48:28,701 --> 00:48:32,667
You can see an example
of that on ehow.com.

1282
00:48:32,667 --> 00:48:33,834
Cutts:
Yeah, absolutely.

1283
00:48:33,834 --> 00:48:35,300
So 500 versus 502--

1284
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:36,567
if you want
to catch me afterwards--

1285
00:48:36,567 --> 00:48:38,234
I think that we do
treat those separately,

1286
00:48:38,234 --> 00:48:40,267
but I'm not 100% sure.

1287
00:48:40,267 --> 00:48:43,801
Um, there's a lot of different
HTTP status codes.

1288
00:48:43,801 --> 00:48:45,901
So 300s typically stand
for redirects.

1289
00:48:45,901 --> 00:48:47,701
200 usually means okay.

1290
00:48:47,701 --> 00:48:49,400
You know,
400 is some sort of error.

1291
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,634
And then, you know,
they mean different things.

1292
00:48:51,634 --> 00:48:54,734
Um, typically whenever
we're doing image searches--

1293
00:48:54,734 --> 00:48:58,267
so let's do an image search
for flowers--

1294
00:48:58,267 --> 00:49:02,000
um, we will try to find
the best picture that we can.

1295
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,067
And if there's a thumbnail,
we will do our best to say,

1296
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:07,133
"Okay, let's find the one
that's a little bit bigger,"

1297
00:49:07,133 --> 00:49:09,000
because users are typically
a little more interested

1298
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,400
in the one that's bigger.

1299
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,567
One thing you can do is try
to shunt a little more page rank

1300
00:49:12,567 --> 00:49:13,801
to the larger image.

1301
00:49:13,801 --> 00:49:15,467
That can help out quite a bit.

1302
00:49:15,467 --> 00:49:17,400
Um, we can also talk
about it offline too.

1303
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,968
Did you--Okay.
Yeah.

1304
00:49:19,968 --> 00:49:22,801
man: Hi. I had a question
about a good site.

1305
00:49:22,801 --> 00:49:24,167
If we could just look at a site

1306
00:49:24,167 --> 00:49:26,000
that follows some
of the best practices.

1307
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,234
And, uh--And I also had
another conference

1308
00:49:29,234 --> 00:49:31,567
where they talked about video
being really important

1309
00:49:31,567 --> 00:49:36,133
on a Website to boost, uh,
ranking and also indexing.

1310
00:49:36,133 --> 00:49:37,400
Cutts:
Yeah, absolutely.

1311
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:41,067
So--And the funny thing is,
uh, what was it,

1312
00:49:41,067 --> 00:49:45,767
Closebys--
I may have lost it.

1313
00:49:45,767 --> 00:49:48,667
Um, Closebys actually had
a very high-production video,

1314
00:49:48,667 --> 00:49:51,167
and they buried it,
like, six layers deep.

1315
00:49:51,167 --> 00:49:53,868
So, uh, a lot of people
ask me, you know,

1316
00:49:53,868 --> 00:49:56,000
"Hey, I want to get
number-one search rankings."

1317
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,767
It turns out,
sometimes it's easier

1318
00:49:57,767 --> 00:49:59,167
to get number-one
search rankings

1319
00:49:59,167 --> 00:50:02,067
by making a great video
or a great blog post

1320
00:50:02,067 --> 00:50:04,701
or a great image
or something that's newsworthy

1321
00:50:04,701 --> 00:50:06,934
rather than just a pure
Web page.

1322
00:50:06,934 --> 00:50:09,234
Um, video, you would be amazed
at the sort of--

1323
00:50:09,234 --> 00:50:11,000
you know,
if you go to YouTube--

1324
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,767
the amount of traffic
that some videos can make.

1325
00:50:14,767 --> 00:50:17,267
In fact, uh,
if I were to search

1326
00:50:17,267 --> 00:50:22,200
for, uh, Google Webmaster
video channel--

1327
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,400
One thing that we've been
doing recently

1328
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,901
is not just recording--

1329
00:50:25,901 --> 00:50:27,901
not just doing blog posts,
but doing videos.

1330
00:50:27,901 --> 00:50:29,033
And they're fantastic,

1331
00:50:29,033 --> 00:50:33,300
because you can take
a Flip, right?

1332
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,834
And Flip video costs...

1333
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:40,601
100 bucks,
a couple hundred bucks, right?

1334
00:50:40,601 --> 00:50:42,601
And you can--I mean, it's like
the size of a cell phone.

1335
00:50:42,601 --> 00:50:44,167
You can carry it
with you everywhere.

1336
00:50:44,167 --> 00:50:46,100
And so if you see something
interesting at a conference,

1337
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:49,000
you just whip that out, and
you can video it very easily.

1338
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,567
So there's no reason

1339
00:50:50,567 --> 00:50:52,667
why you have to put a ton
of work into a blog post.

1340
00:50:52,667 --> 00:50:55,067
Sometimes you can do it
a lot easier with a video.

1341
00:50:55,067 --> 00:50:56,801
Uh, I was doing something
where I was hacking

1342
00:50:56,801 --> 00:50:59,067
a Nintendo Wiimote.

1343
00:50:59,067 --> 00:51:01,000
And I was like, "Oh, this
would look good with a video."

1344
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,934
So you just whip out the Flip,
upload to YouTube.

1345
00:51:03,934 --> 00:51:05,400
You're done in no time at all.

1346
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,200
So we've discovered
that doing--

1347
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,834
We've done something
like 50 different videos.

1348
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:13,767
And, um, what we do
is about every month or two,

1349
00:51:13,767 --> 00:51:15,601
I take questions.

1350
00:51:15,601 --> 00:51:18,167
So, you know, "How important
are brands and ranking?"

1351
00:51:18,167 --> 00:51:20,434
"Does anchor text
carry through 301s?"

1352
00:51:20,434 --> 00:51:22,267
I can answer that question
in a minute and a half

1353
00:51:22,267 --> 00:51:24,400
instead of 20 minutes
or 40 minutes

1354
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,334
or an hour doing a blog post.

1355
00:51:26,334 --> 00:51:27,868
And you can see, you know,

1356
00:51:27,868 --> 00:51:31,000
14,000 people have watched
that first video.

1357
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,434
So two minutes to make,

1358
00:51:32,434 --> 00:51:34,300
and then you can get a ton
of views.

1359
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,901
Video is a very easy way,
where, if you are willing,

1360
00:51:36,901 --> 00:51:38,067
if you have the ability--

1361
00:51:38,067 --> 00:51:39,367
You have to worry
about indemnity.

1362
00:51:39,367 --> 00:51:40,567
You have to think,

1363
00:51:40,567 --> 00:51:42,234
"Do I have permission
to make these videos?"

1364
00:51:42,234 --> 00:51:45,567
But if you do, you'd be amazed
at how viral they can go.

1365
00:51:45,567 --> 00:51:47,701
Um, one tip that I learned--

1366
00:51:47,701 --> 00:51:49,300
You notice
every single one of these

1367
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,968
has me in a red shirt, right?

1368
00:51:51,968 --> 00:51:55,334
So I sat down, and I answered
30 questions all on one time.

1369
00:51:55,334 --> 00:51:57,000
And by the end
of 30 days, everyb--

1370
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,501
I was doing one
of these videos a day.

1371
00:51:58,501 --> 00:52:01,400
By the end, everybody was like,
"Okay, no more of the red shirt.

1372
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:04,133
"Please burn the red shirt.
"I'm so tired of this red shirt.

1373
00:52:04,133 --> 00:52:05,467
Ah, I hate it."

1374
00:52:05,467 --> 00:52:06,634
So I did another one recently.

1375
00:52:06,634 --> 00:52:09,033
And I brought in eight
different T-shirts.

1376
00:52:09,033 --> 00:52:10,400
And I do about five questions,

1377
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,567
and then I'd switch
to a different colored shirt.

1378
00:52:12,567 --> 00:52:14,801
So, you know, these things
are very fast to make.

1379
00:52:14,801 --> 00:52:16,534
You can make 30 or 40 in a day.

1380
00:52:16,534 --> 00:52:18,167
And it can be a way
to rank really well.

1381
00:52:18,167 --> 00:52:21,801
In fact, if you were
to do a search for my name,

1382
00:52:21,801 --> 00:52:23,734
um, you'd probably get my blog.

1383
00:52:23,734 --> 00:52:25,767
You'd get, maybe, you know,
something on Wikipedia

1384
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:27,100
or whatever.

1385
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:29,133
But you--There's something
like five videos ranking

1386
00:52:29,133 --> 00:52:30,200
for my name.

1387
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,767
So it can be a very easy way
to rank.

1388
00:52:31,767 --> 00:52:32,934
And there's not
that many people

1389
00:52:32,934 --> 00:52:34,367
that are thinking
about making videos,

1390
00:52:34,367 --> 00:52:36,501
so it can be
a really big opportunity.

1391
00:52:36,501 --> 00:52:38,367
Yeah, another question
at the mic.

1392
00:52:38,367 --> 00:52:41,567
man: Uh, well, our marketing
people really like PDFs,

1393
00:52:41,567 --> 00:52:43,267
and so they create them first.

1394
00:52:43,267 --> 00:52:46,267
And then, um--and then
I'm one of the people

1395
00:52:46,267 --> 00:52:49,067
who turn them into HTML.

1396
00:52:49,067 --> 00:52:50,767
And I keep telling them to do--

1397
00:52:50,767 --> 00:52:53,467
You know, "We need to do it
the other way."

1398
00:52:53,467 --> 00:52:59,767
Uh, could you speak
about PDFs versus HTML

1399
00:52:59,767 --> 00:53:01,834
and what's likely
to be most searchable

1400
00:53:01,834 --> 00:53:02,868
and et cetera?

1401
00:53:02,868 --> 00:53:04,234
Cutts:
Absolutely.

1402
00:53:04,234 --> 00:53:06,801
So--and just before I go on,
here's a couple videos.

1403
00:53:06,801 --> 00:53:08,100
Qualities of a good site

1404
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:09,534
and the lightning round--
a bunch of questions.

1405
00:53:09,534 --> 00:53:11,801
And that's ranking
with, like, no links

1406
00:53:11,801 --> 00:53:15,400
compared to--these guys
might have hundreds of links.

1407
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,200
So videos can be
a really big opportunity.

1408
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:21,567
Um, yes. PDFs.

1409
00:53:21,567 --> 00:53:24,667
Another one I get
is Flash, right?

1410
00:53:24,667 --> 00:53:26,167
Um, I love Adobe.

1411
00:53:26,167 --> 00:53:28,400
Adobe has done fantastic things.
Photoshop is cool.

1412
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,367
The plug-in aspect of Photoshop
was revolutionary.

1413
00:53:31,367 --> 00:53:34,300
They do amazing things.
Postscript, fantastic.

1414
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:37,300
Flash and PDF
are both very, very cool.

1415
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:39,734
But they're not necessarily
native to the Web.

1416
00:53:39,734 --> 00:53:42,067
And so people
can usually read PDFs,

1417
00:53:42,067 --> 00:53:43,667
but not always.

1418
00:53:43,667 --> 00:53:45,934
And you want it to be
as easy as possible

1419
00:53:45,934 --> 00:53:47,801
for people to buy,
for people to learn,

1420
00:53:47,801 --> 00:53:49,100
for people to do whatever it is

1421
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,000
you want them to do
on your site.

1422
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,901
So think about that
a little bit.

1423
00:53:52,901 --> 00:53:54,734
I would totally agree
if you can make Web pages

1424
00:53:54,734 --> 00:53:56,067
and then go to PDF,

1425
00:53:56,067 --> 00:53:57,667
that can be
a lot more accessible.

1426
00:53:57,667 --> 00:54:00,834
It's a lot easier to link
to an HTML page.

1427
00:54:00,834 --> 00:54:03,534
So HTML pages tend
to attract more page rank

1428
00:54:03,534 --> 00:54:04,734
a little bit faster,

1429
00:54:04,734 --> 00:54:06,067
'cause people
have to link to PDF,

1430
00:54:06,067 --> 00:54:07,534
and then they have to say
it's a PDF link,

1431
00:54:07,534 --> 00:54:09,033
all that sort of stuff.

1432
00:54:09,033 --> 00:54:11,767
And just on Flash for a minute--
Flash is fantastic.

1433
00:54:11,767 --> 00:54:14,501
But it's better
to be decoration in the middle

1434
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:16,901
and not the entire site
in Flash.

1435
00:54:16,901 --> 00:54:19,000
If you can make
static HTML links

1436
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,434
that Googlebot or users
can click,

1437
00:54:21,434 --> 00:54:22,901
that is so much better,

1438
00:54:22,901 --> 00:54:25,000
because we can find
a lot of individual pages,

1439
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,801
which gives you a lot
of individual opportunities

1440
00:54:26,801 --> 00:54:27,968
to rank.

1441
00:54:27,968 --> 00:54:29,901
If it's just one big glob
of Flash,

1442
00:54:29,901 --> 00:54:31,734
that's harder to link to.

1443
00:54:31,734 --> 00:54:33,934
Anybody able to think
of another reason

1444
00:54:33,934 --> 00:54:37,501
why you might not want
your entire site to be in Flash?

1445
00:54:39,634 --> 00:54:42,467
Right? I have a G1,
and I have an iPhone.

1446
00:54:42,467 --> 00:54:45,133
The iPhone
does not handle Flash well.

1447
00:54:45,133 --> 00:54:46,934
And who knows
when that will change.

1448
00:54:46,934 --> 00:54:49,067
So there's
a very great yogurt site--

1449
00:54:49,067 --> 00:54:50,400
Pinkberry, right?

1450
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,000
And if you go to Pinkberry
on an iPhone,

1451
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,934
you're stuck
with a little Flash cube.

1452
00:54:54,934 --> 00:54:56,934
You're like, "I want to know
where I can get yogurt.

1453
00:54:56,934 --> 00:54:57,934
Give me the yogurt."

1454
00:54:57,934 --> 00:54:59,667
And you can't find out.

1455
00:54:59,667 --> 00:55:01,667
There's another site,
you know, Red Mango,

1456
00:55:01,667 --> 00:55:02,868
and they do a better job.

1457
00:55:02,868 --> 00:55:04,267
So, you know,
think about Flash.

1458
00:55:04,267 --> 00:55:05,434
Think about PDFs.

1459
00:55:05,434 --> 00:55:07,667
If you can do it in a Web way,

1460
00:55:07,667 --> 00:55:10,200
I would start with a Web page
and then go to PDF.

1461
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,534
Feel free to say,
"Yeah, Matt said so,"

1462
00:55:11,534 --> 00:55:13,367
or something like that
if it carries any weight.

1463
00:55:13,367 --> 00:55:14,734
Often it doesn't.

1464
00:55:14,734 --> 00:55:16,067
Question. Yeah.

1465
00:55:16,067 --> 00:55:19,000
man: I had a question.
Can you explain how the pa--

1466
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,534
Google decides
to index a page or not?

1467
00:55:21,534 --> 00:55:24,801
I've noticed the page number
in our site up and down,

1468
00:55:24,801 --> 00:55:27,467
even though the content
has not changed.

1469
00:55:27,467 --> 00:55:28,767
Cutts:
Absolutely.

1470
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:32,968
Um, the short answer is Google
basically uses page rank

1471
00:55:32,968 --> 00:55:36,200
to decide which pages to crawl
and how fast to crawl.

1472
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,634
So in the early days,

1473
00:55:37,634 --> 00:55:40,400
you could almost think of it
as sorting by page rank.

1474
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,667
Stanford.edu, CNN,
"New York Times"--

1475
00:55:43,667 --> 00:55:45,634
tons of people link
to these sites.

1476
00:55:45,634 --> 00:55:47,734
And so we start crawling
with those sites.

1477
00:55:47,734 --> 00:55:49,834
And then you find all the links
from"New York Times,"

1478
00:55:49,834 --> 00:55:51,534
and you go outward like that.

1479
00:55:51,534 --> 00:55:54,200
So it's almost entirely--
at least in the beginning--

1480
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,067
a matter of how many links
there were

1481
00:55:56,067 --> 00:55:57,868
and what the importance
of those links were.

1482
00:55:57,868 --> 00:55:59,000
And by the way,

1483
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,868
page rank is not just the number
of links, right?

1484
00:56:00,868 --> 00:56:04,133
Like, if ten people link
to Greg's Web page

1485
00:56:04,133 --> 00:56:06,000
and 15 people link
to my Web page,

1486
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,601
you might be like,
"Aha, I got 15 links."

1487
00:56:08,601 --> 00:56:10,734
But if his ten links
are "New York Times,"

1488
00:56:10,734 --> 00:56:12,067
CNN, "Reader's Digest,"

1489
00:56:12,067 --> 00:56:15,400
and my 15 links
are my college buddies,

1490
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:16,968
he's going to have
more page rank.

1491
00:56:16,968 --> 00:56:18,868
So we're going to crawl
his page first.

1492
00:56:18,868 --> 00:56:21,400
And the same thing applies
to refresh policies.

1493
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:24,367
So we're more likely
to visit stanford.edu,

1494
00:56:24,367 --> 00:56:25,634
you know, once a day

1495
00:56:25,634 --> 00:56:27,467
to figure out
that a page has changed

1496
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:29,934
than we are somebody
that nobody ever links to.

1497
00:56:29,934 --> 00:56:31,968
That said, we try to do
a very good job of crawling

1498
00:56:31,968 --> 00:56:33,767
as much of the Web as we can.

1499
00:56:33,767 --> 00:56:36,767
Even if you don't have any links
at all on your dot-com,

1500
00:56:36,767 --> 00:56:38,901
we can often still discover
your site.

1501
00:56:38,901 --> 00:56:41,467
You can always submit your URL
and things like that.

1502
00:56:41,467 --> 00:56:43,701
But the more people
that do know about you,

1503
00:56:43,701 --> 00:56:45,501
the more we're often able
to crawl

1504
00:56:45,501 --> 00:56:47,200
and the more often
we're able to crawl you.

1505
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,434
So typically, we can refresh
our entire index

1506
00:56:49,434 --> 00:56:53,267
on a weekly or, at worst case,
a monthly sort of basis.

1507
00:56:53,267 --> 00:56:54,467
Another question.
Yeah.

1508
00:56:54,467 --> 00:56:56,467
man: I just had
a couple quick questions.

1509
00:56:56,467 --> 00:56:59,000
Uh, one of them regarding
Google image search.

1510
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,400
Where do you guys--

1511
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,267
What--What text do you look for
to actually index the image on?

1512
00:57:02,267 --> 00:57:04,033
Is it just the ALT text
and image tag,

1513
00:57:04,033 --> 00:57:05,367
or maybe like title text,

1514
00:57:05,367 --> 00:57:08,167
or do you actually take stuff
previous and after it?

1515
00:57:08,167 --> 00:57:09,834
Cutts: The short answer is
we're willing to look

1516
00:57:09,834 --> 00:57:11,234
wherever we can find
useful data.

1517
00:57:11,234 --> 00:57:12,367
So, I mean, in theory,

1518
00:57:12,367 --> 00:57:14,567
you could look at the title
of the URL,

1519
00:57:14,567 --> 00:57:16,267
definitely stuff surrounding
the page,

1520
00:57:16,267 --> 00:57:18,000
absolutely the ALT text.

1521
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,601
Um, it's very hard to understand
the actual content of images.

1522
00:57:21,601 --> 00:57:23,400
Google just released
on Google Labs

1523
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,767
something that lets you sort
by image similarity.

1524
00:57:25,767 --> 00:57:27,167
So you can start
with the Eiffel Tower,

1525
00:57:27,167 --> 00:57:29,634
and it will show you other
pictures of the Eiffel Tower.

1526
00:57:29,634 --> 00:57:31,634
We also have something where,
on Google image search,

1527
00:57:31,634 --> 00:57:33,567
you can say, "Show me faces."

1528
00:57:33,567 --> 00:57:35,400
So you can do a search
like "Paris."

1529
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,567
And then click
"show me faces,"

1530
00:57:36,567 --> 00:57:38,501
and you'll only get
Paris Hilton.

1531
00:57:38,501 --> 00:57:40,133
So we do a little bit
of image understanding,

1532
00:57:40,133 --> 00:57:41,567
but most of the time,

1533
00:57:41,567 --> 00:57:44,267
it's text around or within
the metadata of the image,

1534
00:57:44,267 --> 00:57:45,400
that sort of stuff.

1535
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,801
The more descriptive stuff
you can have,

1536
00:57:46,801 --> 00:57:49,100
instead of, like,
if you call your .jpg

1537
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:51,767
dsc129.jpg,

1538
00:57:51,767 --> 00:57:54,634
that's not as helpful
as flower.jpg.

1539
00:57:54,634 --> 00:57:57,334
So think about all that stuff
and try to incorporate the data.

1540
00:57:57,334 --> 00:57:59,400
man: And if you throw
an image tag in an H1 tag,

1541
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,901
will it get more authority
like the ALT tags do?

1542
00:58:01,901 --> 00:58:03,234
Cutts:
This is a common question.

1543
00:58:03,234 --> 00:58:06,501
H1, you know, is bigger
on the page than H2,

1544
00:58:06,501 --> 00:58:07,868
which is bigger than H3.

1545
00:58:07,868 --> 00:58:09,167
And so a lot of SEOs
are really, like,

1546
00:58:09,167 --> 00:58:11,667
"Okay, everything's
going to be in H1."

1547
00:58:11,667 --> 00:58:13,400
And it's kind of nice
we have this page up, right?

1548
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,734
It's the same attitude.

1549
00:58:14,734 --> 00:58:17,000
I'm going to say the word
furniture 40,000 times.

1550
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,400
I'm really about furniture.

1551
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,934
If you type in furniture,
you have to return me, Google.

1552
00:58:20,934 --> 00:58:22,100
And we don't buy that.

1553
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:24,767
So if you put
your entire page in H1,

1554
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:26,534
uh, we're not going to give it
the same weight

1555
00:58:26,534 --> 00:58:28,267
that we'd give, like, two
or three words.

1556
00:58:28,267 --> 00:58:29,868
So we try to be pretty,
you know,

1557
00:58:29,868 --> 00:58:31,434
intelligent about that.

1558
00:58:31,434 --> 00:58:33,067
I would just do whatever
is natural.

1559
00:58:33,067 --> 00:58:34,701
You know, it's natural
to have an H1,

1560
00:58:34,701 --> 00:58:36,501
have a few sections,
have a few words,

1561
00:58:36,501 --> 00:58:37,901
and have an H2.

1562
00:58:37,901 --> 00:58:40,834
I wouldn't try to use CSS
to make the whole page H1,

1563
00:58:40,834 --> 00:58:42,934
because we do a pretty good job
of detecting that.

1564
00:58:42,934 --> 00:58:44,267
Yeah.
Another question.

1565
00:58:44,267 --> 00:58:47,167
man: Yeah. So I-I guess
what I'm hearing from you,

1566
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:50,667
that if you, say, have a page--
you have, like, an index.php,

1567
00:58:50,667 --> 00:58:54,133
and you give it query parameters
like page=something,

1568
00:58:54,133 --> 00:58:56,367
that's worse than if you had
separate pages,

1569
00:58:56,367 --> 00:58:59,901
you know, like, you know,
whatever, index.php

1570
00:58:59,901 --> 00:59:02,501
and, you know, item,
you know, or, like, you know,

1571
00:59:02,501 --> 00:59:05,000
iTrip or whatever .php,
stuff like that.

1572
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,067
Cutts: Yeah.

1573
00:59:06,067 --> 00:59:08,200
So that's
a fantastic question.

1574
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:12,367
Imagine this page
is index.php

1575
00:59:12,367 --> 00:59:15,300
and val1 or, you know,

1576
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:18,634
item1=val1

1577
00:59:18,634 --> 00:59:22,167
and item2=val2

1578
00:59:22,167 --> 00:59:23,767
and you go on and on and on
like that.

1579
00:59:23,767 --> 00:59:26,300
It used to be that Google
would only crawl URLs

1580
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:28,767
if there were, like, one
or two parameters in the URL.

1581
00:59:28,767 --> 00:59:30,100
We continue to get better.

1582
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:32,334
So you can have 15 parameters
in the URL,

1583
00:59:32,334 --> 00:59:33,801
and we can still crawl that.

1584
00:59:33,801 --> 00:59:36,200
Like, if you looked at some
of the weird URL structure

1585
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:39,200
we had with exclamation points
in it, we'll still crawl that.

1586
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,033
But in general,
for most search engines,

1587
00:59:41,033 --> 00:59:44,133
if you can make something
that's relatively static,

1588
00:59:44,133 --> 00:59:45,968
instead of having
15 parameters,

1589
00:59:45,968 --> 00:59:47,467
it's easier to crawl,

1590
00:59:47,467 --> 00:59:49,267
because if you think about it,
you know,

1591
00:59:49,267 --> 00:59:50,567
if you have 15 parameters,

1592
00:59:50,567 --> 00:59:53,634
usually at least a few
of those parameters do nothing.

1593
00:59:53,634 --> 00:59:55,634
So if you take
that parameter out,

1594
00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:57,667
you get the same URL.

1595
00:59:57,667 --> 00:59:59,601
And now you've got weird
duplicate content issues

1596
00:59:59,601 --> 01:00:02,968
where the same content is
presented on two different URLs.

1597
01:00:02,968 --> 01:00:05,300
So as much as you can reduce
those extra parameters

1598
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:06,634
if you don't need them,

1599
01:00:06,634 --> 01:00:10,067
and, you know, if I were
looking back at this guy,

1600
01:00:10,067 --> 01:00:12,667
rather than having
all these--whoops--

1601
01:00:12,667 --> 01:00:14,501
rather than having
all these weird terms,

1602
01:00:14,501 --> 01:00:19,334
again, if it could be
/audi/s4/2006,

1603
01:00:19,334 --> 01:00:21,667
that's so much more
understandable for a user.

1604
01:00:21,667 --> 01:00:23,133
So I think
that can really be useful.

1605
01:00:23,133 --> 01:00:24,467
It can--
you know, it can help out.

1606
01:00:24,467 --> 01:00:25,734
We do give
a little bit of weight

1607
01:00:25,734 --> 01:00:27,434
for keywords in the URL.

1608
01:00:27,434 --> 01:00:29,434
It's not like
that's the secret.

1609
01:00:29,434 --> 01:00:31,801
You put a keyword in the URL
and now I rank number one.

1610
01:00:31,801 --> 01:00:33,367
But every little bit helps.

1611
01:00:33,367 --> 01:00:35,534
So if you can have a few things
that make sense for users,

1612
01:00:35,534 --> 01:00:36,934
where they can see the URL

1613
01:00:36,934 --> 01:00:38,701
and get rid of these sort
of multiple parameters,

1614
01:00:38,701 --> 01:00:40,200
it does help a little bit.

1615
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,834
And I think we're pretty close
to the end of the session.

1616
01:00:42,834 --> 01:00:45,334
How about
one last question.

1617
01:00:45,334 --> 01:00:48,601
man: We put a database online
that was unique information.

1618
01:00:48,601 --> 01:00:49,701
We just did it.

1619
01:00:49,701 --> 01:00:52,133
And I know the guidelines
about length

1620
01:00:52,133 --> 01:00:53,634
and number of links,

1621
01:00:53,634 --> 01:00:55,200
but are those
just guidelines?

1622
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,100
Can we break that
in a situation

1623
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:58,467
that requires it?

1624
01:00:58,467 --> 01:00:59,634
Cutts:
Very good question.

1625
01:00:59,634 --> 01:01:01,200
So if you look
at Google's guidelines,

1626
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:05,434
there's one thing that says,
"Avoid having over 100 links."

1627
01:01:05,434 --> 01:01:07,434
And that's not
in our spam guidelines.

1628
01:01:07,434 --> 01:01:09,801
We're not going to penalize you
if you have over 100 links.

1629
01:01:09,801 --> 01:01:11,801
That's in a different section.

1630
01:01:11,801 --> 01:01:13,534
The reason
why we said that originally

1631
01:01:13,534 --> 01:01:16,234
is because we used
to only crawl 101 kilobytes.

1632
01:01:16,234 --> 01:01:19,000
And so we didn't want people
having a four-megabyte file.

1633
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,334
Remember, when you have
a one-megabyte image download,

1634
01:01:21,334 --> 01:01:23,067
that can be really
kind of a pain.

1635
01:01:23,067 --> 01:01:24,667
So originally,
we recommended 100 links

1636
01:01:24,667 --> 01:01:27,400
just so that people wouldn't
have their pages be too big.

1637
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:28,801
Now we crawl a lot more--

1638
01:01:28,801 --> 01:01:31,901
We'll save a lot more
than 101 kilobytes of your page.

1639
01:01:31,901 --> 01:01:34,133
So that guideline
is getting a little stale.

1640
01:01:34,133 --> 01:01:37,167
You know, having up to hundreds
of links on your page is okay.

1641
01:01:37,167 --> 01:01:40,267
What you really don't want
is a ton of really spammy links.

1642
01:01:40,267 --> 01:01:41,567
You know, the sort of thing

1643
01:01:41,567 --> 01:01:44,467
like, uh,
the blogsearch.biz guy,

1644
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:45,601
like this.

1645
01:01:45,601 --> 01:01:47,734
If you had 100 links
like this,

1646
01:01:47,734 --> 01:01:49,734
that would get really,
really annoying.

1647
01:01:49,734 --> 01:01:51,667
But if you
have just normal links,

1648
01:01:51,667 --> 01:01:54,734
that I wouldn't necessarily
worry that much about.

1649
01:01:54,734 --> 01:01:56,067
Okay, so thanks very much.

1650
01:01:56,067 --> 01:01:57,434
If there's people
who have questions,

1651
01:01:57,434 --> 01:01:59,200
we'll stick around
for a little while afterwards.

1652
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,734
Thanks.

1653
01:02:00,734 --> 01:02:03,000
[applause]
