00:00:03,567 --> 00:00:04,834
Stearns:
My name's Geoff Stearns.

2
00:00:04,834 --> 00:00:06,767
I work also
on the syndication team.

3
00:00:06,767 --> 00:00:09,334
I guess you're hearing
lots of people

4
00:00:09,334 --> 00:00:10,634
from syndication today.

5
00:00:10,634 --> 00:00:12,534
I primarily work
on the video player.

6
00:00:12,534 --> 00:00:15,234
So normally
when you would see

7
00:00:15,234 --> 00:00:19,067
a YouTube video,

8
00:00:19,067 --> 00:00:21,334
uh, on a Web site
that is not YouTube,

9
00:00:21,334 --> 00:00:22,701
it's probably
playing back

10
00:00:22,701 --> 00:00:24,033
in one of the players
that I work on.

11
00:00:24,033 --> 00:00:25,868
So we have
a few different players.

12
00:00:25,868 --> 00:00:27,701
I think you've heard
a little bit about them.

13
00:00:27,701 --> 00:00:30,100
I'm gonna talk about two players
in particular.

14
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,033
One is the standard
embedded player,

15
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:33,934
which is probably the one
that you're all familiar with

16
00:00:33,934 --> 00:00:35,267
and the one
that you've seen,

17
00:00:35,267 --> 00:00:37,868
you know,
around on the Internet.

18
00:00:37,868 --> 00:00:39,901
And then the chromeless player,
which has probably

19
00:00:39,901 --> 00:00:41,334
been mentioned
a few times today already,

20
00:00:41,334 --> 00:00:43,400
which is our sort of super
customizable player.

21
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,667
So let's get started,
I guess.

22
00:00:46,667 --> 00:00:48,100
I guess first of all
I wanted to talk

23
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,701
a little bit
about the embedded player.

24
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:51,400
Now, the chromeless player--

25
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,834
Uh, well, let me back up.

26
00:00:53,834 --> 00:00:55,634
So the embedded player
generally, I feel,

27
00:00:55,634 --> 00:01:00,000
would probably be okay
for probably 99%

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,767
of your needs,
in my opinion.

29
00:01:02,767 --> 00:01:04,267
The chromeless player
is exciting and all,

30
00:01:04,267 --> 00:01:05,767
but the embedded player

31
00:01:05,767 --> 00:01:07,234
really brings everything
together.

32
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:10,701
So the embedded player,
you guys have all seen it.

33
00:01:10,701 --> 00:01:13,367
Let me show you
a quick example of it

34
00:01:13,367 --> 00:01:17,501
just to show
a little demo here.

35
00:01:17,501 --> 00:01:19,300
Oops, I already
have this open.

36
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,567
So this here
are a few examples

37
00:01:21,567 --> 00:01:23,834
of videos embedded
using our embedded player.

38
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:25,534
And you can see there's
a couple different layouts

39
00:01:25,534 --> 00:01:29,968
and color options
you can make.

40
00:01:29,968 --> 00:01:31,834
We can even watch
a couple videos here

41
00:01:31,834 --> 00:01:33,267
that are pretty funny.

42
00:01:33,267 --> 00:01:39,434
Do we have audio?

43
00:01:39,434 --> 00:01:44,634
Yes? No?

44
00:01:44,634 --> 00:01:47,300
There it goes.

45
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,501
Yeah, I think
they just turned it up.

46
00:02:01,968 --> 00:02:05,801
[techno rock music]

47
00:02:05,801 --> 00:02:10,133
[video game sounds
of hitting and punching]

48
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:12,067
[shouting indistinctly]

49
00:02:25,634 --> 00:02:27,434
[man growling]

50
00:02:27,434 --> 00:02:30,267
[laughter]

51
00:02:30,267 --> 00:02:32,067
So there's not really
a lot of point in that.

52
00:02:32,067 --> 00:02:34,033
I just wanted to show it to you.
It's pretty funny.

53
00:02:34,033 --> 00:02:36,701
Um...

54
00:02:36,701 --> 00:02:38,534
The one thing
to sorta get outta this

55
00:02:38,534 --> 00:02:40,033
is you can see that
with the embedded player

56
00:02:40,033 --> 00:02:42,033
there's a lot
of customization options, okay?

57
00:02:42,033 --> 00:02:44,267
You can set the color
of the control bar.

58
00:02:44,267 --> 00:02:47,100
You can add a border
around it if you want to.

59
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,067
These down here, we sorta
call this the genie menu.

60
00:02:50,067 --> 00:02:52,100
Although it used to look
more like more of a genie thing.

61
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,434
Now it's just sort of
a slide forward thumbnail menu.

62
00:02:55,434 --> 00:02:57,701
You can enable this
or disable this if you want.

63
00:02:57,701 --> 00:02:59,367
A lot of people ask,
you know--

64
00:02:59,367 --> 00:03:00,868
I actually talked
to someone recently

65
00:03:00,868 --> 00:03:02,501
who said they really wanted
to use the embedded player

66
00:03:02,501 --> 00:03:04,501
but they hate how it shows
these related videos

67
00:03:04,501 --> 00:03:06,067
that could be, like,
a competitor,

68
00:03:06,067 --> 00:03:08,667
or it could be, you know,
a random spornography

69
00:03:08,667 --> 00:03:10,868
or something like that,
and you might not want that.

70
00:03:10,868 --> 00:03:12,200
And you can disable it.

71
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,234
So I'll go through
that stuff in a minute.

72
00:03:14,234 --> 00:03:17,267
Um, a couple other examples
of videos

73
00:03:17,267 --> 00:03:19,167
and just a couple of other
videos that are kinda fun.

74
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:20,767
So we'll watch those.

75
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:22,901
[jingling sound]

76
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:24,834
[man speaking foreign language]

77
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:42,067
[bottles jingling
"Mario Bros." theme song]

78
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:56,000
Stearns: Does anyone here
have this much free time?

79
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,501
No?

80
00:03:57,501 --> 00:04:01,934
[man speaking indistinctly]

81
00:04:01,934 --> 00:04:04,667
Yeah?

82
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:06,133
I'd volunteer
our parking garage

83
00:04:06,133 --> 00:04:10,501
if anybody wants
to do this later.

84
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:13,400
All right, so let's take
a quick look at--

85
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,067
[audience chuckling]

86
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:19,334
Uh...

87
00:04:19,334 --> 00:04:22,200
So let's take a quick look
at the options

88
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,334
that you have available
for the normal embedded player.

89
00:04:25,334 --> 00:04:29,033
If you go to our YouTube site
on the code.google.com site,

90
00:04:29,033 --> 00:04:32,000
we have a couple of pages that
relate just to the player thing.

91
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,033
So we have
YouTube player tools here.

92
00:04:34,033 --> 00:04:35,734
There's a page
called "player parameters"

93
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:38,167
that talks about the different
customizations you can do.

94
00:04:38,167 --> 00:04:40,033
And then we have
some JavaScript and Flash APIs

95
00:04:40,033 --> 00:04:41,334
and the chromeless player stuff.

96
00:04:41,334 --> 00:04:43,300
So this is, like,
your one resource place

97
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,467
for anything you want to know
about the players.

98
00:04:46,467 --> 00:04:49,801
So quickly
I'll step through this stuff.

99
00:04:49,801 --> 00:04:51,434
This is a list of all
the different parameters

100
00:04:51,434 --> 00:04:52,767
you can use
on the player.

101
00:04:52,767 --> 00:04:54,734
And a lot of people
sort of gloss over

102
00:04:54,734 --> 00:04:57,100
or maybe don't realize that you
can actually customize them.

103
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,834
And it's really easy
to customize the player.

104
00:04:58,834 --> 00:05:01,167
All you do is you go
to the YouTube site.

105
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:03,167
Just give you
a quick example here.

106
00:05:03,167 --> 00:05:06,868
You pick the video
that you want.

107
00:05:06,868 --> 00:05:08,901
Grab the embed code here.

108
00:05:08,901 --> 00:05:10,534
And when you stick it
in your page,

109
00:05:10,534 --> 00:05:12,701
or whatever you're
putting it into here,

110
00:05:12,701 --> 00:05:14,767
all you have to do
is modify a few variables.

111
00:05:14,767 --> 00:05:16,968
So you could notice
there's the URL to the player

112
00:05:16,968 --> 00:05:18,400
in two places here.

113
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,200
There's this one here.

114
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,701
And this has
a few parameters.

115
00:05:21,701 --> 00:05:24,200
Now this part right here
is the actual URL to the player.

116
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,801
And if you just use
that plain URL,

117
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:27,400
you'll just get
the normal standard player

118
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,234
that's just the gray that
you've probably seen a lot.

119
00:05:29,234 --> 00:05:31,467
But all these other
variables here, uh,

120
00:05:31,467 --> 00:05:33,334
are extra things
that you can customize.

121
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:34,901
And you can actually
come in and change these.

122
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:37,067
So like color one,
color two right here,

123
00:05:37,067 --> 00:05:38,300
these are just hex values.

124
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,734
So you can set them
to any hex value you want.

125
00:05:40,734 --> 00:05:42,968
Color two is the color
of the control bar,

126
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:44,934
and then color one
is the color of the border

127
00:05:44,934 --> 00:05:47,334
or sort of like the secondary
color of the player

128
00:05:47,334 --> 00:05:48,601
if you turn the border on.

129
00:05:48,601 --> 00:05:50,701
HL is a language.

130
00:05:50,701 --> 00:05:53,501
We support I don't know
how many languages.

131
00:05:53,501 --> 00:05:55,367
Maybe 18 different languages
right now?

132
00:05:55,367 --> 00:05:57,033
So you can actually
tell the player

133
00:05:57,033 --> 00:05:59,534
to be whichever language
we support.

134
00:05:59,534 --> 00:06:02,400
We're always adding
new languages.

135
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,667
I think by default
it's whatever user language

136
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:06,834
you used when you got
the embed code.

137
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:09,167
FS is a new one
that I haven't documented yet,

138
00:06:09,167 --> 00:06:11,300
but I'll tell you guys
about that in a second here.

139
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,067
Um, so that's how
you edit that.

140
00:06:14,067 --> 00:06:17,334
Let me go back
to my page here.

141
00:06:17,334 --> 00:06:19,334
All right, so really quickly I'm
just gonna run through these,

142
00:06:19,334 --> 00:06:21,033
'cause these are pretty useful
for most people.

143
00:06:21,033 --> 00:06:24,634
So the rel argument is,
like I said earlier,

144
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,067
it's to turn on or turn off

145
00:06:26,067 --> 00:06:27,567
the related videos
in the player.

146
00:06:27,567 --> 00:06:29,200
So either when you push
the menu button

147
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,367
or when the video ends,
if you set rel to zero,

148
00:06:31,367 --> 00:06:33,901
then you don't see
those related videos.

149
00:06:33,901 --> 00:06:36,133
Autoplay just lets the player
autoplay when it loads up.

150
00:06:36,133 --> 00:06:38,634
You guys can see certain sites
like Digg uses that one,

151
00:06:38,634 --> 00:06:39,934
you load a video on Digg.

152
00:06:39,934 --> 00:06:41,400
You can set it to loop.

153
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,868
So if you want to have a video
just loop forever,

154
00:06:42,868 --> 00:06:44,701
you can set loop to one
and it'll loop forever.

155
00:06:44,701 --> 00:06:46,667
All these values, if they're
like a Boolean value,

156
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:48,200
it's either one or zero.

157
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,100
So make sure you don't put
like "true" or "false" in there.

158
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,167
It actually has to be
a one or a zero.

159
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:55,334
Enable JSAPI and player API ID
are kinda special ones.

160
00:06:55,334 --> 00:06:57,367
I'm gonna talk about those
in a little bit.

161
00:06:57,367 --> 00:07:00,100
Disable KB just disables
the keyboard controls.

162
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,701
A lot of people don't know
that the players

163
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:03,501
have some keyboard controls.

164
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:04,934
They're listed out here.

165
00:07:04,934 --> 00:07:06,834
So you can use spacebar
to play and pause the player.

166
00:07:06,834 --> 00:07:08,501
Or you can use
your left and right arrow keys

167
00:07:08,501 --> 00:07:10,868
to jump ahead or jump back
to the beginning.

168
00:07:10,868 --> 00:07:12,567
And then up and down
arrow keys

169
00:07:12,567 --> 00:07:16,133
change your volume
up and down.

170
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:18,167
EGM is kind of a weird one.

171
00:07:18,167 --> 00:07:19,601
I don't want to spend
too much time on that.

172
00:07:19,601 --> 00:07:20,901
But it basically
makes it so that

173
00:07:20,901 --> 00:07:23,167
if you set EGM to one,
when you hover over

174
00:07:23,167 --> 00:07:25,234
the video player
with your mouse,

175
00:07:25,234 --> 00:07:27,334
it brings that little menu up
over the video.

176
00:07:27,334 --> 00:07:29,734
So it lets you kinda,
I guess,

177
00:07:29,734 --> 00:07:31,467
helps discoverability
a little bit.

178
00:07:31,467 --> 00:07:32,901
The border one or zero

179
00:07:32,901 --> 00:07:34,467
turns on that border
that's around the player.

180
00:07:34,467 --> 00:07:37,100
And you can set that
on or off.

181
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,167
And then color one, color two
is what I already mentioned

182
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,033
for setting the colors.

183
00:07:41,033 --> 00:07:43,000
And then there's a few other
example usage here.

184
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,501
And there's another example
of the video player

185
00:07:44,501 --> 00:07:45,868
with a blue border.

186
00:07:45,868 --> 00:07:46,968
So I think a lot of people,

187
00:07:46,968 --> 00:07:48,300
they ask
for the chromeless player.

188
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,200
But really this player
is really, really flexible

189
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,267
and would probably suit
most of your needs.

190
00:07:52,267 --> 00:07:53,534
And then this way
you don't have to build

191
00:07:53,534 --> 00:07:55,701
your own control setup
since we already have our,

192
00:07:55,701 --> 00:07:58,734
you know, pretty standard
controls already set up there.

193
00:07:58,734 --> 00:08:00,767
Another thing to notice
is that this site--

194
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,501
this player also allows you
to set the player

195
00:08:02,501 --> 00:08:03,834
any size you want.

196
00:08:03,834 --> 00:08:06,067
So it doesn't have to be,
like, a standard 4x3.

197
00:08:06,067 --> 00:08:07,701
You can actually set it
to, like, wide-screen

198
00:08:07,701 --> 00:08:10,033
like the last video
I showed you guys.

199
00:08:10,033 --> 00:08:12,000
Or you can shrink it
or make it bigger.

200
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,501
You know, pretty much
whatever size you want,

201
00:08:13,501 --> 00:08:15,934
the player will just fill
whatever size you give it,

202
00:08:15,934 --> 00:08:17,934
which is nice.

203
00:08:17,934 --> 00:08:20,000
There's not a way to set
the quality yet.

204
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,501
Sorry.

205
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:26,834
Um, let's see here.

206
00:08:26,834 --> 00:08:28,534
All right,
so let's go back.

207
00:08:28,534 --> 00:08:30,234
So...

208
00:08:30,234 --> 00:08:32,133
let me go back
to my examples here.

209
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:35,834
Oops.

210
00:08:35,834 --> 00:08:37,667
All right, one more video
and then we'll move on.

211
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:39,100
This one's good.

212
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,100
So the FS parameter, actually
it's not documented yet.

213
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,701
But I added full screen
functionality

214
00:08:42,701 --> 00:08:44,434
to the embedded player
last week.

215
00:08:44,434 --> 00:08:46,133
So you guys can now
use your embeds.

216
00:08:46,133 --> 00:08:48,234
If you just go and get
the new code from the Web site,

217
00:08:48,234 --> 00:08:50,601
you can watch stuff
in full screen now.

218
00:08:50,601 --> 00:08:52,100
man: A slightly larger balloon,
an 80 inch.

219
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,467
Stearns: It looks like
the projector's kinda

220
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:54,801
screwing it up
a little bit.

221
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:56,767
But really it should--
it would fill the whole screen

222
00:08:56,767 --> 00:08:58,334
if it was
on a normal display.

223
00:08:58,334 --> 00:09:01,934
man: I keep the rubber band
with me.

224
00:09:01,934 --> 00:09:04,000
Stearns: This guy's name
is Billoon45,

225
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,834
and he's a balloon fetishist.

226
00:09:05,834 --> 00:09:08,200
This was his second attempt
at trying to climb

227
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,734
inside of a balloon.

228
00:09:11,734 --> 00:09:13,467
[chuckles]

229
00:09:13,467 --> 00:09:14,801
Gunther likes this guy.

230
00:09:14,801 --> 00:09:16,601
This guy is basically like
the patron saint

231
00:09:16,601 --> 00:09:19,100
of the YouTube web developers
for the most part.

232
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,300
man: Oh, forgot the glasses.

233
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:26,267
They gotta come off.

234
00:09:26,267 --> 00:09:28,334
Well, my head's inside.

235
00:09:32,801 --> 00:09:34,200
Whoa.

236
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,767
Stearns: I think there's only
one end of it, I guess.

237
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:40,033
I think it's, like, a big
South American weather balloon

238
00:09:40,033 --> 00:09:41,334
or something like that.

239
00:09:41,334 --> 00:09:43,100
He actually tells you
what it is.

240
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,601
man: My arm.

241
00:09:45,601 --> 00:09:47,701
My head's inside.

242
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:58,767
Whoa.

243
00:09:58,767 --> 00:10:00,434
Darn it.

244
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:03,334
That's the last thing
I need now.

245
00:10:03,334 --> 00:10:06,567
Not fucking cooperating.

246
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:07,834
Oh, great.

247
00:10:07,834 --> 00:10:09,767
I'm becoming trapped
in the balloon.

248
00:10:09,767 --> 00:10:11,434
Drat!

249
00:10:11,434 --> 00:10:15,334
Oh, I hate this.

250
00:10:15,334 --> 00:10:17,767
Oh, darn it.

251
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:20,267
Oh.

252
00:10:20,267 --> 00:10:22,033
Blast it.

253
00:10:22,033 --> 00:10:24,767
I can still breathe.

254
00:10:24,767 --> 00:10:29,334
Hmm.

255
00:10:29,334 --> 00:10:32,767
Hmm, I gotta get
out of this balloon.

256
00:10:32,767 --> 00:10:35,601
[groaning]

257
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:38,334
Drat it.

258
00:10:38,334 --> 00:10:42,667
[groaning]

259
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:44,868
Let's find me
a spot here.

260
00:10:49,901 --> 00:10:52,000
[groaning]

261
00:10:57,267 --> 00:10:58,901
Stearns: I think that's
my favorite part right there

262
00:10:58,901 --> 00:11:03,234
when he does
the little shimmy.

263
00:11:03,234 --> 00:11:05,367
man: I ripped the balloon.

264
00:11:12,501 --> 00:11:15,000
Drat dog.

265
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,968
Hate that.

266
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:18,667
Stearns: This guy's awesome.

267
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:23,534
[audience chuckling]

268
00:11:23,534 --> 00:11:24,868
This is fantastic.

269
00:11:24,868 --> 00:11:27,734
All right.

270
00:11:27,734 --> 00:11:29,267
He does a lot
of confessionals too.

271
00:11:29,267 --> 00:11:31,334
I highly recommend his channel.
It's really good.

272
00:11:31,334 --> 00:11:33,667
Um, it's Billoon45
is the name

273
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:35,200
if you guys
want to look it up.

274
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,834
So anyway,
so really quickly,

275
00:11:36,834 --> 00:11:39,000
the full screen mode
that's there now,

276
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,334
any new embeds that you grab
from the YouTube site

277
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:43,834
should have
the full screen embed.

278
00:11:43,834 --> 00:11:46,033
But you do have to do
a little bit of special stuff.

279
00:11:46,033 --> 00:11:47,400
If you have, like,
an existing Web site

280
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,167
that uses our embed code,
you have to add

281
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:52,234
an allow full screen
parameter and attribute

282
00:11:52,234 --> 00:11:53,634
to your embed code.

283
00:11:53,634 --> 00:11:55,133
And if you guys want to see
what that looks like,

284
00:11:55,133 --> 00:11:56,934
you can just grab any embed code
from the YouTube site

285
00:11:56,934 --> 00:11:58,367
and you'll see it in there.

286
00:11:58,367 --> 00:12:00,667
And then there's another
player parameter called FS.

287
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:02,534
And you set that
to either one or zero

288
00:12:02,534 --> 00:12:04,834
to either show or hide
the actual full screen button.

289
00:12:04,834 --> 00:12:07,434
So we do that because
a lot of our old embed code

290
00:12:07,434 --> 00:12:09,300
didn't have the
"allow full screen" parameter.

291
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,701
So if we showed the button,
the button just wouldn't work.

292
00:12:11,701 --> 00:12:14,567
So in some cases
we'll actually hide the button

293
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,000
on sites that don't support
the full screen embed code.

294
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,667
So have some fun with that.

295
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:23,534
Um, all right.

296
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,234
It's hard to think
after watching that video there.

297
00:12:26,234 --> 00:12:27,801
Let's go back
to the thing.

298
00:12:27,801 --> 00:12:30,334
All right, so another thing
that I want to talk about

299
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:31,767
is the JavaScript
and Flash API.

300
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:34,467
So in the embedded player
and in the chromeless player,

301
00:12:34,467 --> 00:12:36,701
they both can support
a JavaScript API

302
00:12:36,701 --> 00:12:38,267
for controlling the player.

303
00:12:38,267 --> 00:12:39,701
And they can also support
a Flash API.

304
00:12:39,701 --> 00:12:41,000
So if you're working
with ActionScript,

305
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,968
you can load the player
into your ActionScript app

306
00:12:42,968 --> 00:12:45,000
and have pretty much
full control

307
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,667
over the players that way.

308
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:49,834
The APIs are pretty much
identical, with some exceptions

309
00:12:49,834 --> 00:12:51,467
as to how you initialize
the player

310
00:12:51,467 --> 00:12:53,434
when you load it
into a Flash app,

311
00:12:53,434 --> 00:12:57,100
which I guess is probably
to be expected a little bit.

312
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,067
I want to
kinda briefly go over

313
00:12:59,067 --> 00:13:00,534
the JavaScript API reference,

314
00:13:00,534 --> 00:13:03,267
and I'll get more into this
a little bit later.

315
00:13:03,267 --> 00:13:06,467
So the key thing
to know about, I guess,

316
00:13:06,467 --> 00:13:08,133
for using the JavaScript API--

317
00:13:08,133 --> 00:13:09,467
Let me actually
show the demo first,

318
00:13:09,467 --> 00:13:10,934
and then we'll
get back into it.

319
00:13:10,934 --> 00:13:12,634
So this is, like, a really quick
demo page I set up.

320
00:13:12,634 --> 00:13:14,501
This is actually linked
off of the bottom

321
00:13:14,501 --> 00:13:16,434
of the JavaScript
reference page

322
00:13:16,434 --> 00:13:18,100
on the code.google.com site.

323
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,667
So this is just
a normal embedded player

324
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:20,734
embedded on a page.

325
00:13:20,734 --> 00:13:22,234
And I have
some HTML controls here

326
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:25,000
that enable JavaScript
controls to the player.

327
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,467
So I can hit play,

328
00:13:26,467 --> 00:13:28,367
and the player
will start playing.

329
00:13:28,367 --> 00:13:30,000
You have pretty good
support over it.

330
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,634
I can hit pause.

331
00:13:31,634 --> 00:13:35,100
You can mute it
or un-mute it,

332
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,701
which I think my sound
went away again.

333
00:13:37,701 --> 00:13:39,067
But that's okay.

334
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:40,901
[rock music]

335
00:13:40,901 --> 00:13:42,868
You can seek around
within the player.

336
00:13:42,868 --> 00:13:44,968
So you can seek
to any time you want.

337
00:13:44,968 --> 00:13:48,734
You can seek ahead to, uh,

338
00:13:48,734 --> 00:13:50,501
say, like, 150 seconds.

339
00:13:50,501 --> 00:13:52,801
So you can see ahead
to points in the video

340
00:13:52,801 --> 00:13:54,167
that haven't loaded yet.

341
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,200
So if you guys have noticed,

342
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,067
YouTube uses sort of like
a custom streaming method,

343
00:13:59,067 --> 00:14:00,400
I guess you would call it.

344
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,033
All of our videos
are progressive download.

345
00:14:02,033 --> 00:14:04,033
But the way
that we serve them

346
00:14:04,033 --> 00:14:05,400
is that we can actually
start playing them

347
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,834
from any point
in the video.

348
00:14:06,834 --> 00:14:09,267
So you can actually
jump ahead in the video

349
00:14:09,267 --> 00:14:10,400
and start playing points

350
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,868
that haven't actually
downloaded yet.

351
00:14:11,868 --> 00:14:13,334
And it'll just make
a new request to the server

352
00:14:13,334 --> 00:14:14,767
and start downloading it.

353
00:14:14,767 --> 00:14:16,567
And you can see that happening
here where I jumped ahead.

354
00:14:16,567 --> 00:14:18,667
Or I can, like, jump back
to here that hasn't loaded,

355
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:20,467
and it'll just jump
to that point and start loading.

356
00:14:20,467 --> 00:14:22,434
So the JavaScript API
along with, you know,

357
00:14:22,434 --> 00:14:24,434
just the player controls
give you access to that.

358
00:14:24,434 --> 00:14:26,267
So you could actually
have a player that loads,

359
00:14:26,267 --> 00:14:27,634
start playing it
from the middle of the video

360
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:29,067
if you wanted to,
and let it play, like, a segment

361
00:14:29,067 --> 00:14:30,534
and then stop it
or whatever.

362
00:14:30,534 --> 00:14:34,801
So you can do lots of really
fine granular control there.

363
00:14:34,801 --> 00:14:37,000
And then you can
see down here

364
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,634
I have some numbers
being put out here.

365
00:14:39,634 --> 00:14:41,200
So one of them
is the duration

366
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,067
where I grab the duration
from the player.

367
00:14:43,067 --> 00:14:45,200
The other one is the current
time of the video.

368
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,334
So you can key events

369
00:14:46,334 --> 00:14:47,834
according to how
the video is playing

370
00:14:47,834 --> 00:14:49,734
and what the current time
in the video is.

371
00:14:49,734 --> 00:14:51,901
You can also get
how many bytes have loaded,

372
00:14:51,901 --> 00:14:53,501
how many bytes are total.

373
00:14:53,501 --> 00:14:55,100
And then the start bytes,
which is, you know,

374
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,467
in the case where you
start it from the middle,

375
00:14:56,467 --> 00:14:57,901
you can know
what the start bytes are.

376
00:14:57,901 --> 00:14:59,501
So if you wanted to,
you could recreate

377
00:14:59,501 --> 00:15:01,501
the seek bar here
using that data.

378
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:03,200
So you could have your own
custom seek bar or whatever

379
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,734
if you wanted to,
and that really comes into play

380
00:15:04,734 --> 00:15:06,968
when you're using the chromeless
player for the most part.

381
00:15:06,968 --> 00:15:09,767
There's also ways
to get and set the volume,

382
00:15:09,767 --> 00:15:12,901
um, and mute it.

383
00:15:12,901 --> 00:15:14,834
Uh, and I think that's it.

384
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:18,033
We'll go through that stuff
in a little bit.

385
00:15:18,033 --> 00:15:20,133
So...

386
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:22,767
this is our JavaScript API
reference.

387
00:15:22,767 --> 00:15:24,400
All the functions
are listed out here.

388
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,133
You have play, stop, pause.

389
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,801
I'm not gonna go
through all of them

390
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:30,067
'cause they're probably
pretty self-apparent I think.

391
00:15:30,067 --> 00:15:33,033
Um...

392
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:34,334
Seek to--

393
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:36,367
One thing to note
when you're seeking with videos

394
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:39,000
is that the FLV format
has a limitation

395
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,067
to where you can seek to
in that you can only seek

396
00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:43,501
to a key frame
within the video.

397
00:15:43,501 --> 00:15:44,968
And if you're familiar
with video,

398
00:15:44,968 --> 00:15:46,701
you know that there's not
a key frame every second,

399
00:15:46,701 --> 00:15:48,167
or every frame even.

400
00:15:48,167 --> 00:15:49,501
The key frames
are usually spread out.

401
00:15:49,501 --> 00:15:51,100
And in my experience,
key frames on YouTube

402
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,100
are usually between
two seconds all the way up--

403
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,667
I've seen them as far apart
as 15 seconds unfortunately.

404
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:58,567
So we have been working
a little bit

405
00:15:58,567 --> 00:15:59,934
on getting that
closer together

406
00:15:59,934 --> 00:16:01,701
and trying to set up
a standard way of saying

407
00:16:01,701 --> 00:16:03,834
any video should only have
key frames

408
00:16:03,834 --> 00:16:06,234
at a maximum as far apart
as two seconds,

409
00:16:06,234 --> 00:16:07,901
which makes seeking
a little bit better.

410
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:09,767
But in some cases,
with older videos that haven't,

411
00:16:09,767 --> 00:16:11,567
you know, that were encoded
a long time ago,

412
00:16:11,567 --> 00:16:14,367
you might see a little bit
worse performance in that case.

413
00:16:14,367 --> 00:16:16,100
So that's something
to worry about.

414
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,267
If you call seek to

415
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,734
and say you want to go
to seconds--

416
00:16:18,734 --> 00:16:20,100
like, 15 seconds
into the video,

417
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,133
and the first key frame
before that happens to be

418
00:16:22,133 --> 00:16:23,567
at, like, seven seconds,

419
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:25,167
they player will always jump
to the key frame

420
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:26,734
before the time
that you requested.

421
00:16:26,734 --> 00:16:28,434
So the user will always see

422
00:16:28,434 --> 00:16:30,200
the content that you
intended them to see.

423
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,133
But they might see a little bit
ahead of that time as well.

424
00:16:33,133 --> 00:16:34,934
And you guys could do
some trickery where, you know,

425
00:16:34,934 --> 00:16:37,033
you seek to 15,
and if it doesn't go to 15,

426
00:16:37,033 --> 00:16:38,434
you could, like,
hide the player

427
00:16:38,434 --> 00:16:40,067
and mute it or something
until it gets to 15

428
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:41,400
and then show it.

429
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,167
So, I mean, you guys
could sort of hack together

430
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:48,133
a real sort of accurate
seek time thing.

431
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:49,968
The allow seek ahead parameter

432
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:52,267
is just the way
to allow you to either

433
00:16:52,267 --> 00:16:54,367
tell the player--
allow the player to jump ahead

434
00:16:54,367 --> 00:16:56,234
and make a new request
to the server

435
00:16:56,234 --> 00:16:58,200
or only seek within the part
that's already downloaded.

436
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,100
So you can actually
genuinely build, like,

437
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,501
a seek bar that works
the same way that ours does.

438
00:17:03,501 --> 00:17:05,167
Um...

439
00:17:05,167 --> 00:17:08,334
Everything else here
is pretty standard.

440
00:17:08,334 --> 00:17:12,000
Um, the add event listener
is the way that you listen

441
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,734
to state changes
in the player.

442
00:17:13,734 --> 00:17:15,434
So when the player loads,
you can--

443
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:18,100
you can set up a listener
for this on state change event.

444
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,901
So any time
the player state changes,

445
00:17:19,901 --> 00:17:21,501
like, if the user
plays it or pauses it

446
00:17:21,501 --> 00:17:23,834
or the video ends,
you can listen for that state

447
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,000
and then act upon it.

448
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,667
So you can know
when the video ends

449
00:17:26,667 --> 00:17:28,434
or if the user paused it.

450
00:17:28,434 --> 00:17:30,000
You could also compare
the current time

451
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,334
to the duration
of the video as well

452
00:17:31,334 --> 00:17:33,167
and find it out that way.

453
00:17:33,167 --> 00:17:34,801
But the events are probably
a little cleaner.

454
00:17:34,801 --> 00:17:36,734
And then
there's an error event,

455
00:17:36,734 --> 00:17:38,634
which this only has
one error listed,

456
00:17:38,634 --> 00:17:40,234
but there's actually two
different errors you can get.

457
00:17:40,234 --> 00:17:42,601
One would be if the video
has been taken down,

458
00:17:42,601 --> 00:17:45,133
or if it's now private,
or something like that.

459
00:17:45,133 --> 00:17:49,267
And the other one
is if the video is, uh,

460
00:17:49,267 --> 00:17:51,501
has embedding disabled,

461
00:17:51,501 --> 00:17:53,267
which I believe
is a 101 error.

462
00:17:53,267 --> 00:17:55,634
But I haven't updated
the documentation yet.

463
00:17:55,634 --> 00:17:57,334
The way that this works

464
00:17:57,334 --> 00:17:58,901
is when you load the player
in the page,

465
00:17:58,901 --> 00:18:00,434
you have to add
a player parameter

466
00:18:00,434 --> 00:18:02,167
in order to enable
the JavaScript API,

467
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:03,667
called enable JSAPI.

468
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:05,734
You set it to one.

469
00:18:05,734 --> 00:18:07,300
And what this does
is it tells the player

470
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,467
that you want the JavaScript API
to be turned on.

471
00:18:09,467 --> 00:18:11,367
And so by default
it's turned off

472
00:18:11,367 --> 00:18:13,033
so we don't call
random JavaScript functions

473
00:18:13,033 --> 00:18:14,634
on everybody's pages.

474
00:18:14,634 --> 00:18:16,100
Once you call that,

475
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,634
when the player
loads on the page,

476
00:18:17,634 --> 00:18:20,000
it's going to call
this function called

477
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,501
"on YouTube player ready"

478
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:25,167
which is mentioned right here.

479
00:18:25,167 --> 00:18:26,901
Right here.

480
00:18:26,901 --> 00:18:28,901
So what you do
is you specify this function

481
00:18:28,901 --> 00:18:30,934
called "on YouTube player ready"
in JavaScript on your page.

482
00:18:30,934 --> 00:18:33,033
Once the player loads, it calls
on YouTube player ready,

483
00:18:33,033 --> 00:18:35,300
and that's how you know
the player is ready.

484
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,968
Um, there is a certain case

485
00:18:36,968 --> 00:18:38,934
where if you have more
than one player on your page,

486
00:18:38,934 --> 00:18:40,734
you might not know
which one is ready.

487
00:18:40,734 --> 00:18:43,601
So there's another variable
called player--

488
00:18:43,601 --> 00:18:46,267
"player API ID,"
which is right here.

489
00:18:46,267 --> 00:18:48,367
And you basically just set that
to any string that you want.

490
00:18:48,367 --> 00:18:50,501
It should be, like,
a unique string, obviously.

491
00:18:50,501 --> 00:18:52,467
And what happens
is when the player then calls

492
00:18:52,467 --> 00:18:53,834
on YouTube player ready,

493
00:18:53,834 --> 00:18:55,501
it'll pass that string
back to that function.

494
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:56,901
So you know which
of your players is ready

495
00:18:56,901 --> 00:18:58,567
and which ones
are still initializing.

496
00:18:58,567 --> 00:18:59,701
Yeah?

497
00:18:59,701 --> 00:19:04,734
[man speaking indistinctly]

498
00:19:04,734 --> 00:19:06,767
Stearns: Um, so the--

499
00:19:06,767 --> 00:19:07,934
Yeah, so the question is

500
00:19:07,934 --> 00:19:09,367
is there a way
to stay in full screen

501
00:19:09,367 --> 00:19:10,667
and jump from video
to video?

502
00:19:10,667 --> 00:19:12,334
In the normal embedded player,
no, there's not.

503
00:19:12,334 --> 00:19:14,534
There's no way to load
a new video at this point.

504
00:19:14,534 --> 00:19:16,200
It is something
that I want to add,

505
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,200
but I don't know how long
it'll be until that's added.

506
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,901
With the chromeless player,
you could do that.

507
00:19:20,901 --> 00:19:22,534
So in the chromeless player,
it doesn't have

508
00:19:22,534 --> 00:19:24,200
native full screen
functionality that we do.

509
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,567
But if you load
the chromeless player

510
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,767
into your own SWF
and make that go full screen,

511
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:30,033
then you could load a new video
into the chromeless player,

512
00:19:30,033 --> 00:19:31,467
and it would stay
in full screen,

513
00:19:31,467 --> 00:19:32,767
and you could load
the new video.

514
00:19:32,767 --> 00:19:34,234
So you guys could do, like,
a full immersive

515
00:19:34,234 --> 00:19:35,868
full screen mode where they
never have to leave

516
00:19:35,868 --> 00:19:39,300
and load whatever videos
you want.

517
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,801
Um, let's see.

518
00:19:41,801 --> 00:19:43,234
So that's pretty much it.

519
00:19:43,234 --> 00:19:44,801
There's a lot of other
example code on this page

520
00:19:44,801 --> 00:19:46,300
to get you started.

521
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,734
And the demo that I showed
is down here at the bottom

522
00:19:47,734 --> 00:19:50,634
where the sample stuff is at.

523
00:19:50,634 --> 00:19:53,534
So let me show you
a couple other demos

524
00:19:53,534 --> 00:19:57,267
using the embedded player.

525
00:19:57,267 --> 00:19:58,767
So here's something
that I put together

526
00:19:58,767 --> 00:20:00,534
after I made the API.

527
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:03,267
This was sort of inspired
by a mashup I saw a while back

528
00:20:03,267 --> 00:20:05,601
on the Internet called--

529
00:20:05,601 --> 00:20:07,067
It was using a video
called "Rendezvous,"

530
00:20:07,067 --> 00:20:09,534
and it a guy--it's an old
classic video apparently

531
00:20:09,534 --> 00:20:11,100
of a guy who races
through Paris

532
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,767
going really, really fast
in a car.

533
00:20:12,767 --> 00:20:14,434
And somebody had taken
a Google Maps thing

534
00:20:14,434 --> 00:20:15,801
and had planned out his route

535
00:20:15,801 --> 00:20:17,434
and synchronized it
with the video.

536
00:20:17,434 --> 00:20:18,834
Only it was, like,
fake synchronization

537
00:20:18,834 --> 00:20:20,133
where you had to, like,
start the video

538
00:20:20,133 --> 00:20:21,467
and then start the map
at the same time

539
00:20:21,467 --> 00:20:23,267
and hope that
they were synched up.

540
00:20:23,267 --> 00:20:24,667
So I did this video
as sort of--

541
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:25,868
kind of a parody of that,

542
00:20:25,868 --> 00:20:27,133
but then also
sort of a showcase

543
00:20:27,133 --> 00:20:29,400
of what you can do
with the embedded player API.

544
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,801
So what this does
is it takes this race

545
00:20:32,801 --> 00:20:37,133
that goes down
a really twisty street here

546
00:20:37,133 --> 00:20:39,868
in San Francisco,
and it sort of synchronizes

547
00:20:39,868 --> 00:20:43,801
the guys' travel down the street
on this Google Map.

548
00:20:43,801 --> 00:20:45,601
[crowd cheering]

549
00:20:45,601 --> 00:20:48,167
So unlike the other mashup
that I had seen,

550
00:20:48,167 --> 00:20:50,367
this one actually
synchronizes it with the player.

551
00:20:50,367 --> 00:20:51,767
Since we're using
the player API,

552
00:20:51,767 --> 00:20:54,300
we already know
where the player position is

553
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,567
when you're playing stuff back.

554
00:20:55,567 --> 00:20:57,100
So if I back up here,
you'll see the map

555
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,234
will stay synchronized with it
and back up with it.

556
00:20:59,234 --> 00:21:01,334
So I can actually drag this
and, like, jump ahead,

557
00:21:01,334 --> 00:21:02,734
and the map will always
stay synchronized

558
00:21:02,734 --> 00:21:05,868
exactly with where
the guy is in the video.

559
00:21:05,868 --> 00:21:08,300
So this isn't real GPS data.
I wish it were.

560
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,701
That would make it
really cool.

561
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:11,167
I actually set up--

562
00:21:11,167 --> 00:21:12,767
There's sort of like
a debug mode on the map's code

563
00:21:12,767 --> 00:21:14,033
that I borrowed
from the other guy

564
00:21:14,033 --> 00:21:15,934
where you can just kinda
click on the map in an area

565
00:21:15,934 --> 00:21:18,067
and it'll follow
where you're clicking.

566
00:21:18,067 --> 00:21:20,701
So you can, you know, plan out
the area you want to go to.

567
00:21:20,701 --> 00:21:22,901
And then I just sort of manually
tweaked it a little bit.

568
00:21:22,901 --> 00:21:24,767
man: Whoo.

569
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:26,334
Stearns: And if you view
the source of this page,

570
00:21:26,334 --> 00:21:28,300
all the source is there,
you guys can look at it.

571
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,868
Uh, the URL's right here
if you can see that.

572
00:21:30,868 --> 00:21:32,834
It's linked
on my presentation.

573
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:34,667
So if you grab
my presentation,

574
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:38,234
you can see it.

575
00:21:38,234 --> 00:21:42,234
Okay, let's go back
to this here.

576
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:44,901
All right,
so here's another thing.

577
00:21:44,901 --> 00:21:47,501
This was actually started
as, I think, a 20% project

578
00:21:47,501 --> 00:21:50,234
of a Google engineer
down in Mountain View.

579
00:21:50,234 --> 00:21:53,100
They wanted to have
a debate tool,

580
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,467
I guess you could call it,

581
00:21:54,467 --> 00:21:56,501
where they wanted to watch
these presidential debates,

582
00:21:56,501 --> 00:21:57,901
and then add
a sort of transcript,

583
00:21:57,901 --> 00:22:00,501
and then also have a sort of
interactive feature to it

584
00:22:00,501 --> 00:22:02,567
where, you know,
if a politician said something

585
00:22:02,567 --> 00:22:04,400
in their debate,
you could look it up

586
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,934
and then, you know,
add the transcript later

587
00:22:05,934 --> 00:22:07,501
saying, you know, "This
isn't necessarily accurate."

588
00:22:07,501 --> 00:22:09,400
You know, "There might be
some other stuff here."

589
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,701
Or, you know,
"This is accurate.

590
00:22:10,701 --> 00:22:12,501
And in addition,
here's some more information."

591
00:22:12,501 --> 00:22:14,334
So there's a few different
videos here.

592
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:15,767
And you can actually pick one.

593
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,334
And you have this transcript
for the video

594
00:22:17,334 --> 00:22:19,300
that goes along next to it.

595
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,701
And you can jump around
by either clicking here,

596
00:22:21,701 --> 00:22:23,400
and you can jump around
the video.

597
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,801
Or if you just watch
the video,

598
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:26,534
this transcript will stay
synchronized the whole time

599
00:22:26,534 --> 00:22:27,701
while you're watching it.

600
00:22:27,701 --> 00:22:30,567
It's a pretty nice
use of it I think.

601
00:22:30,567 --> 00:22:31,701
man: And especially Mexico.

602
00:22:31,701 --> 00:22:33,467
Southern Mexico,
it was a disaster.

603
00:22:33,467 --> 00:22:35,667
It destroyed the entire
agricultural economy.

604
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:37,801
Guess what happened,
they all came north.

605
00:22:37,801 --> 00:22:39,467
If NAFTA had worked
so well as--

606
00:22:39,467 --> 00:22:41,667
Stearns: Oh, my God.

607
00:22:41,667 --> 00:22:43,601
Um, let's see.

608
00:22:43,601 --> 00:22:45,267
And then this is
sort of the same idea.

609
00:22:45,267 --> 00:22:46,901
This was, uh--

610
00:22:46,901 --> 00:22:49,767
Michael Geary actually
came up to us at Google I/O

611
00:22:49,767 --> 00:22:52,467
a few weeks back
and saw the demos.

612
00:22:52,467 --> 00:22:53,901
And I think
he went home that night

613
00:22:53,901 --> 00:22:56,767
and coded this into
a jQuery plugin the next day,

614
00:22:56,767 --> 00:22:58,033
and showed up at our booth
and said,

615
00:22:58,033 --> 00:22:59,601
"Hey, look what I made.
It's pretty cool."

616
00:22:59,601 --> 00:23:00,801
So this is really neat.

617
00:23:00,801 --> 00:23:02,667
This is sort of like
a presentation tool

618
00:23:02,667 --> 00:23:04,200
where he took a video--

619
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,767
I believe he gave a talk
at Google a while back

620
00:23:06,767 --> 00:23:08,934
about YouTube map mashups

621
00:23:08,934 --> 00:23:10,367
where he did
some election maps

622
00:23:10,367 --> 00:23:12,601
using YouTube Maps
and the maps API.

623
00:23:12,601 --> 00:23:14,701
woman: All right,
so this is Mike Geary.

624
00:23:14,701 --> 00:23:16,067
So I originally--

625
00:23:16,067 --> 00:23:17,667
Stearns: So he made
this little tool.

626
00:23:17,667 --> 00:23:19,067
And this is actually
a jQuery plugin

627
00:23:19,067 --> 00:23:20,334
that you can take

628
00:23:20,334 --> 00:23:22,167
and add a bunch
of pointers to your video.

629
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,434
And this is, you can see,
it's, like, an hour-long video

630
00:23:24,434 --> 00:23:25,834
of the presentation.

631
00:23:25,834 --> 00:23:27,834
And as it goes through,
this will follow along.

632
00:23:27,834 --> 00:23:30,000
You can see it just
changed there on its own.

633
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,534
And then in this
big area here,

634
00:23:31,534 --> 00:23:33,234
it actually loads in
a URL that you give it,

635
00:23:33,234 --> 00:23:34,934
or it could load, you know,
it could load a slide

636
00:23:34,934 --> 00:23:36,834
of your presentation
if you wanted it to.

637
00:23:36,834 --> 00:23:38,534
Or in his case,
he actually loads

638
00:23:38,534 --> 00:23:41,167
different HTML pages
and the actual Maps demos

639
00:23:41,167 --> 00:23:43,367
that he's talking about
in the apps.

640
00:23:43,367 --> 00:23:48,801
Like, if you look at
Iowa maps API map,

641
00:23:48,801 --> 00:23:52,400
you can see
this actually loads

642
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,267
the thing that he's talking
about in the thing here.

643
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:56,000
And this is actually
a live Google Maps thing.

644
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,868
So you can move it around
and play with it and zoom in

645
00:23:57,868 --> 00:24:00,033
and actually play with it
while the talk is going on

646
00:24:00,033 --> 00:24:01,434
while you're listening
to the talk.

647
00:24:01,434 --> 00:24:03,100
So I thought this was
a really nice use

648
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,367
of the player API.

649
00:24:04,367 --> 00:24:05,734
And it always
stays synchronized

650
00:24:05,734 --> 00:24:08,367
as the video plays.

651
00:24:08,367 --> 00:24:10,100
And the source code
is all there.

652
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,367
I think it's anno two,
but I guess he called it--

653
00:24:13,367 --> 00:24:14,767
And like I said,
it's a jQuery plugin.

654
00:24:14,767 --> 00:24:16,167
So if you're using
jQuery already,

655
00:24:16,167 --> 00:24:17,801
it's really easy
to get started and using it.

656
00:24:17,801 --> 00:24:20,767
You just basically
set your stuff up and go.

657
00:24:20,767 --> 00:24:22,834
Um...

658
00:24:22,834 --> 00:24:24,667
All right.

659
00:24:24,667 --> 00:24:28,167
So...

660
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:30,367
Um, the Flash API,
does anybody use Flash?

661
00:24:30,367 --> 00:24:31,701
Anybody care about Flash?

662
00:24:31,701 --> 00:24:33,000
Should I go over
the Flash stuff?

663
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,701
All right, there's
a good number of people.

664
00:24:34,701 --> 00:24:36,100
So I'll talk about it
a little bit.

665
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,501
There's not really
a lot to talk about.

666
00:24:37,501 --> 00:24:38,868
Everything that's in
the JavaScript API

667
00:24:38,868 --> 00:24:40,968
that I mentioned is also
available in the Flash API.

668
00:24:40,968 --> 00:24:43,801
So it's pretty much
the same thing.

669
00:24:43,801 --> 00:24:45,400
The one caveat
is that our players

670
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,033
are written
in ActionScript 2.

671
00:24:47,033 --> 00:24:48,501
I'm sorry.

672
00:24:48,501 --> 00:24:50,033
But we do that
so we reach more people.

673
00:24:50,033 --> 00:24:51,501
So I know all you guys
are probably using

674
00:24:51,501 --> 00:24:53,000
crazy ActionScript three.

675
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,200
You can still embed the player
in ActionScript three,

676
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,634
but it takes a little bit
of extra work.

677
00:24:57,634 --> 00:24:59,434
So you're probably familiar
if you're a Flash developer

678
00:24:59,434 --> 00:25:02,601
that AS 2 cannot talk
directly to an AS 3 SWF.

679
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:04,667
So you have to write
some sort of wrapper

680
00:25:04,667 --> 00:25:06,567
that uses either
external interface

681
00:25:06,567 --> 00:25:08,767
or a local connection
to talk between the SWFs.

682
00:25:08,767 --> 00:25:11,300
I've seen a few people do it.

683
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,667
I think this presentation--

684
00:25:12,667 --> 00:25:14,400
or one of these demos
I'm gonna show does it.

685
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,267
So it is possible.

686
00:25:16,267 --> 00:25:17,767
And there's
a lot of talk about it

687
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:19,234
on our GData API forum

688
00:25:19,234 --> 00:25:20,667
if you guys are interested
in checking it out

689
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:22,934
and you want
to get on there.

690
00:25:22,934 --> 00:25:24,567
Um...

691
00:25:24,567 --> 00:25:26,200
The only difference really
with the Flash API

692
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,434
is how you load the player.

693
00:25:27,434 --> 00:25:29,100
So you actually load it
into a movie clip,

694
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,667
and then you can call this

695
00:25:30,667 --> 00:25:32,567
"is player loaded" call.

696
00:25:32,567 --> 00:25:34,334
You basically have to set up
some sort of loop or something

697
00:25:34,334 --> 00:25:36,501
that checks
until it's loaded.

698
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:38,400
And then when it's loaded,
it'll let you know,

699
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:44,868
and you can start calling
all the API calls.

700
00:25:44,868 --> 00:25:47,567
Um, okay.

701
00:25:47,567 --> 00:25:50,501
So the chromeless player.

702
00:25:50,501 --> 00:25:52,601
The chromeless player,
I can actually claim

703
00:25:52,601 --> 00:25:56,267
that I designed
the chromeless player.

704
00:25:56,267 --> 00:25:57,868
The visual design, that is.

705
00:25:57,868 --> 00:25:59,467
And that's because it doesn't
have a visual design.

706
00:25:59,467 --> 00:26:01,601
All it has is a logo.

707
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:05,033
So to show you an example
of the chromeless player

708
00:26:05,033 --> 00:26:08,100
I suppose...

709
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,567
[clears throat]

710
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:12,534
Here it is.
Ta-da!

711
00:26:12,534 --> 00:26:14,467
Hold the applause, please.
No applause.

712
00:26:14,467 --> 00:26:19,100
[laughter]

713
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,067
All right, so the idea
behind the chromeless player

714
00:26:21,067 --> 00:26:23,701
was that we wanted
to give people

715
00:26:23,701 --> 00:26:26,501
as much control
over our player as we could,

716
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:28,601
within reason obviously.

717
00:26:28,601 --> 00:26:31,534
So we still want to add
all of our cool features,

718
00:26:31,534 --> 00:26:35,200
like, you know,
annotations and things and--

719
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,901
Excuse me.

720
00:26:36,901 --> 00:26:40,734
And all the fun stuff.

721
00:26:40,734 --> 00:26:42,634
And also hopefully
make it easier

722
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:46,367
for you guys to develop
with our things,

723
00:26:46,367 --> 00:26:48,067
with our videos,
I should say.

724
00:26:48,067 --> 00:26:49,634
So the chromeless player
has all the same controls,

725
00:26:49,634 --> 00:26:51,200
JavaScript controls,
Flash controls,

726
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,100
as the embedded player does,

727
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,901
only it doesn't have
all the extra stuff,

728
00:26:54,901 --> 00:26:56,434
like, you know,
the related videos

729
00:26:56,434 --> 00:26:59,367
and the color settings
and the control bar and things.

730
00:27:02,601 --> 00:27:04,734
All right.

731
00:27:04,734 --> 00:27:09,267
So, um,
that's pretty much it.

732
00:27:09,267 --> 00:27:12,267
I want to show you guys
some demos

733
00:27:12,267 --> 00:27:14,801
'cause I already have
this one up.

734
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:16,334
This one was
a pretty recent thing.

735
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:19,634
This was done
by a little agency

736
00:27:19,634 --> 00:27:22,701
in, I don't know, I think
Philadelphia or something.

737
00:27:22,701 --> 00:27:24,234
And this is for JCPenney.

738
00:27:24,234 --> 00:27:26,667
And they did, like,
a little karaoke machine.

739
00:27:26,667 --> 00:27:29,534
And you can actually
start singing.

740
00:27:29,534 --> 00:27:30,901
And what it does is it--

741
00:27:30,901 --> 00:27:33,000
They basically capture
their own video,

742
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,534
and it's a Flash app
obviously.

743
00:27:34,534 --> 00:27:35,934
It's, like,
a full page thing.

744
00:27:35,934 --> 00:27:39,334
I think it's actually AS 3.

745
00:27:39,334 --> 00:27:44,567
And let's do
"Ballroom Blitz" I guess.

746
00:27:44,567 --> 00:27:47,767
And it records you--

747
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:49,334
I guess it'll record me.

748
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,801
I don't know,
I'll have to like--

749
00:27:50,801 --> 00:27:52,968
I'll have to scoot down here.

750
00:27:52,968 --> 00:27:54,267
Oh, no.

751
00:27:54,267 --> 00:27:57,067
Well, it didn't find
my webcam properly.

752
00:27:57,067 --> 00:27:59,067
Whoops.

753
00:27:59,067 --> 00:28:01,133
We don't want
to watch that one again.

754
00:28:01,133 --> 00:28:02,501
man: Watch the balloon again.

755
00:28:02,501 --> 00:28:04,100
Stearns: Yeah.

756
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:07,167
I'm gonna bring a balloon
to this thing next time.

757
00:28:07,167 --> 00:28:08,701
Let me open that up again.

758
00:28:08,701 --> 00:28:10,300
All right,
I'll just show you guys one

759
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,601
that somebody has made.

760
00:28:11,601 --> 00:28:13,901
So what they do is they
basically record the camera

761
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:15,200
in their app.

762
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,834
They send it up to--

763
00:28:16,834 --> 00:28:19,734
They can sort of transpose
and sort of--

764
00:28:19,734 --> 00:28:21,267
I don't know, I guess
"transpose" isn't the word.

765
00:28:21,267 --> 00:28:24,133
They can sort of mash up
all these sort of different,

766
00:28:24,133 --> 00:28:27,968
uh, effects and things
that they've done

767
00:28:27,968 --> 00:28:30,701
that are similar to, like,
what you can do in iChat

768
00:28:30,701 --> 00:28:32,567
if you have the most
recent version of iChat.

769
00:28:32,567 --> 00:28:34,834
And then they send it
to YouTube.

770
00:28:34,834 --> 00:28:38,167
And then they play it back
using the chromeless player.

771
00:28:38,167 --> 00:28:39,901
So this is the chromeless player
loaded into their app,

772
00:28:39,901 --> 00:28:41,200
and then they have
their own custom UI.

773
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,300
You know, it's real simple,
just play/pause.

774
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,167
And then you can listen
to all these people singing.

775
00:28:45,167 --> 00:28:46,868
So it's like
a karaoke app.

776
00:28:46,868 --> 00:28:49,567
man singing softly:
And I ran.

777
00:28:49,567 --> 00:28:52,434
I ran so far away.

778
00:28:52,434 --> 00:28:56,000
Stearns: Yeah, not everybody
really gets into it as much.

779
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,267
man singing:
I couldn't get away.

780
00:29:02,167 --> 00:29:03,734
Stearns: We could find
a good one I guess.

781
00:29:03,734 --> 00:29:05,133
Let's find somebody good.

782
00:29:05,133 --> 00:29:06,434
This guy looks like a pro.

783
00:29:06,434 --> 00:29:10,200
[laughter]

784
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,534
Yeah.

785
00:29:11,534 --> 00:29:13,601
man singing:
I'm all out of love.

786
00:29:13,601 --> 00:29:16,000
I'm so lost without you.

787
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,801
I knew you were right

788
00:29:17,801 --> 00:29:20,367
believing for so long.

789
00:29:20,367 --> 00:29:22,234
in falsetto:
I'm all out of love.

790
00:29:22,234 --> 00:29:24,467
I'm so lost without you.

791
00:29:24,467 --> 00:29:26,901
I knew you were right.

792
00:29:26,901 --> 00:29:30,367
Rachel, come back.

793
00:29:30,367 --> 00:29:34,601
Ahh-ah-ah!

794
00:29:34,601 --> 00:29:37,534
Get this thing
out of my face.

795
00:29:37,534 --> 00:29:39,734
Stearns: Yeah, so--

796
00:29:39,734 --> 00:29:40,934
[laughter]

797
00:29:40,934 --> 00:29:42,634
So the way
that this works, I believe,

798
00:29:42,634 --> 00:29:44,601
is they capture frames
of the video, or the video,

799
00:29:44,601 --> 00:29:47,501
and then add their effects on
the client's side using Flash.

800
00:29:47,501 --> 00:29:49,000
And all these effects
that you see,

801
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,234
like the stars
flying around things,

802
00:29:50,234 --> 00:29:52,334
I think are actually done
in Flash

803
00:29:52,334 --> 00:29:53,734
using, you know,
just random things.

804
00:29:53,734 --> 00:29:55,067
And then you can do,
like, different stuff.

805
00:29:55,067 --> 00:29:56,767
And you can actually
manipulate bitmap stuff

806
00:29:56,767 --> 00:29:58,734
really well in Flash, so.

807
00:29:58,734 --> 00:30:00,200
And then they take that
and they send--

808
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,734
they compile the video
on their server,

809
00:30:01,734 --> 00:30:03,467
and then suit it up
to YouTube using the API

810
00:30:03,467 --> 00:30:05,133
and then load it
back through the API

811
00:30:05,133 --> 00:30:08,100
into their app there
and display it all.

812
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,767
So it's a really nice use.

813
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:11,734
I have a few other demos
of the chromeless player

814
00:30:11,734 --> 00:30:13,667
that I want
to show you guys too.

815
00:30:13,667 --> 00:30:16,167
If you're not up to writing
your own player that uses it,

816
00:30:16,167 --> 00:30:20,167
there's a really popular player
called JW FLV player

817
00:30:20,167 --> 00:30:21,868
that some of you
may have heard of.

818
00:30:21,868 --> 00:30:23,033
It's pretty popular.

819
00:30:23,033 --> 00:30:24,767
If you don't recognize
these controls,

820
00:30:24,767 --> 00:30:26,734
you probably will see it around
the Internet at some point.

821
00:30:26,734 --> 00:30:28,667
It's a really popular
just sort of really generic

822
00:30:28,667 --> 00:30:30,834
FLV player that plays
pretty much anything.

823
00:30:30,834 --> 00:30:33,300
And it's really, really
customizable.

824
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,167
So when I did
the chromeless player,

825
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:36,701
I told this guy about it.

826
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:38,701
And he was interested
to get the chromeless player

827
00:30:38,701 --> 00:30:39,868
into his player.

828
00:30:39,868 --> 00:30:41,334
So you can actually
use this player now

829
00:30:41,334 --> 00:30:44,234
to play YouTube videos because
it uses the chromeless player.

830
00:30:44,234 --> 00:30:46,033
[David Hasselhoff's
"Jump in My Car" plays]

831
00:30:46,033 --> 00:30:52,334
So he chose also a really
awesome video to demo this.

832
00:30:52,334 --> 00:30:56,067
Hasselhoff singing:
Jump in my car.

833
00:30:56,067 --> 00:30:59,834
I want to take you home.

834
00:30:59,834 --> 00:31:03,601
Come on and jump in my car.

835
00:31:03,601 --> 00:31:08,467
It's too far
to walk on your own.

836
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:10,033
women singing:
No, thank you, sir.

837
00:31:10,033 --> 00:31:11,334
Hasselhoff singing:
Oh, come on.

838
00:31:11,334 --> 00:31:12,734
Stearns:
And you can see here

839
00:31:12,734 --> 00:31:14,067
it's really customizable.

840
00:31:14,067 --> 00:31:15,334
And you can go through here
and customize

841
00:31:15,334 --> 00:31:16,501
pretty much anything.

842
00:31:16,501 --> 00:31:17,801
You can auto start.

843
00:31:17,801 --> 00:31:20,868
He actually has
a full screen option here too.

844
00:31:20,868 --> 00:31:22,234
[man speaking indistinctly]

845
00:31:22,234 --> 00:31:23,934
Stearns: No.

846
00:31:23,934 --> 00:31:25,167
man: Too much of it.

847
00:31:25,167 --> 00:31:26,701
Stearns:
What, you don't like this?

848
00:31:26,701 --> 00:31:28,601
You don't like The Hoff?

849
00:31:28,601 --> 00:31:30,567
[song begins again]

850
00:31:30,567 --> 00:31:33,100
Uh, and I'm not
really sure why,

851
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,133
but the YouTube logo
gets really big on this one

852
00:31:35,133 --> 00:31:36,501
when it goes full screen.

853
00:31:36,501 --> 00:31:38,234
But you can actually call
set size on the player,

854
00:31:38,234 --> 00:31:39,434
and set it to the size,

855
00:31:39,434 --> 00:31:41,167
and the logo should stay
the small size.

856
00:31:41,167 --> 00:31:42,934
So he must be doing
something funky with that.

857
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:46,467
But you should be able
to get that fixed there.

858
00:31:46,467 --> 00:31:48,634
So that's sort of an example
of the chromeless player.

859
00:31:48,634 --> 00:31:50,567
So going full screen.

860
00:31:50,567 --> 00:31:51,834
So, like, you can see this.

861
00:31:51,834 --> 00:31:55,100
And if you were
to customize this player

862
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,767
to allow, you know,
to load new videos,

863
00:31:56,767 --> 00:31:58,133
then you could have
a full screen player

864
00:31:58,133 --> 00:31:59,501
that just always stays
full screen,

865
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:01,801
and just always loads
new videos as they sit there.

866
00:32:01,801 --> 00:32:03,267
Hasselhoff singing:
How can you say that?

867
00:32:03,267 --> 00:32:04,534
We've only just met.

868
00:32:04,534 --> 00:32:06,901
Stearns: Yeah.

869
00:32:06,901 --> 00:32:08,167
It's a good video.

870
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:10,367
You guys should watch that
at some point.

871
00:32:10,367 --> 00:32:12,801
man: Is it possible to detect

872
00:32:12,801 --> 00:32:15,067
the exit of the full screen?

873
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:16,534
Stearns: So is it possible

874
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:17,934
to detect the exit
of the full screen?

875
00:32:17,934 --> 00:32:20,033
Yes, if you're using
Flash, you can.

876
00:32:20,033 --> 00:32:22,434
Whatever the container
movie clip is,

877
00:32:22,434 --> 00:32:23,968
there's an on full screen event
that gets fired,

878
00:32:23,968 --> 00:32:25,634
and it tells you if it's
going into full screen

879
00:32:25,634 --> 00:32:27,000
or exiting full screen.

880
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,133
man: What about in files
using JavaScript?

881
00:32:29,133 --> 00:32:30,868
Stearns: No.

882
00:32:30,868 --> 00:32:33,033
Our player doesn't have that
built in either.

883
00:32:33,033 --> 00:32:35,834
[man speaking indistinctly]

884
00:32:35,834 --> 00:32:38,734
Stearns: Right, I mean,
it could be as simple

885
00:32:38,734 --> 00:32:41,901
as making a SWF that proxy's
the JavaScript calls

886
00:32:41,901 --> 00:32:43,467
to the JavaScript
into our player

887
00:32:43,467 --> 00:32:44,834
and that also has

888
00:32:44,834 --> 00:32:47,000
the on full screen event handler
and, like, that's it.

889
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,667
So it would be
a pretty simple SWF

890
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:50,000
if that's all you wanted.

891
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,200
man: Would the events
that are defined by RealPlayer

892
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,701
be allocated out--

893
00:32:54,701 --> 00:32:57,067
Stearns: You'd have
to do it yourself.

894
00:32:57,067 --> 00:32:58,968
man: So we'd pretty much
have to recreate everything--

895
00:32:58,968 --> 00:33:00,901
Stearns: Yeah, but that API's
not that big.

896
00:33:00,901 --> 00:33:02,868
So it wouldn't be
that difficult.

897
00:33:02,868 --> 00:33:04,400
There's another question
back there.

898
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,868
man: Yeah, what's the advantage
of using the chromeless player

899
00:33:06,868 --> 00:33:10,968
[continues indistinctly]

900
00:33:10,968 --> 00:33:13,033
Stearns: Um, well,
the difference is that

901
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:16,434
we don't allow people
to access our FLVs directly.

902
00:33:16,434 --> 00:33:18,000
You have to jump
through a lot of hoops to do it.

903
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,968
And it's not supported by us,
and we really discourage it.

904
00:33:21,968 --> 00:33:23,968
The reason being
is that we have--

905
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,934
We give a lot of users options
when they upload their videos.

906
00:33:25,934 --> 00:33:27,234
Like, they'll only want this
to be available

907
00:33:27,234 --> 00:33:28,834
in this country,

908
00:33:28,834 --> 00:33:31,667
or maybe they only want their
friends to be able to see it.

909
00:33:31,667 --> 00:33:33,501
And if you go
to the FLVs directly,

910
00:33:33,501 --> 00:33:34,767
you bypass all of that.

911
00:33:34,767 --> 00:33:36,200
So our players are, like,
the gateway.

912
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,267
So our players are sort of,
you know,

913
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:40,634
playing the cop
to our FLV things

914
00:33:40,634 --> 00:33:42,801
to enforce people's options.

915
00:33:42,801 --> 00:33:44,300
So you could in fact
piss off your users

916
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,667
if they went to your site
and you started playing

917
00:33:45,667 --> 00:33:47,000
their private videos,
and they'd be like,

918
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,267
"What's wrong with you guys?"

919
00:33:48,267 --> 00:33:49,734
So it's better to use
the chromeless player

920
00:33:49,734 --> 00:33:51,234
or the embedded player.

921
00:33:51,234 --> 00:33:53,501
And then we won't send you
nasty illegal letters either.

922
00:33:53,501 --> 00:33:54,801
[laughter]

923
00:33:54,801 --> 00:33:57,100
Small--small footnote there.

924
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,501
Um, any other questions
before we keep going?

925
00:33:59,501 --> 00:34:01,267
All right, I'll leave some
time at the end for questions.

926
00:34:01,267 --> 00:34:02,767
Actually, how much longer
do I have?

927
00:34:02,767 --> 00:34:04,901
15 minutes.

928
00:34:04,901 --> 00:34:06,734
I think so.
All right.

929
00:34:06,734 --> 00:34:09,133
A few more examples.

930
00:34:09,133 --> 00:34:11,367
This is a company
called Slide.

931
00:34:11,367 --> 00:34:13,634
They do a lot
of Facebook apps and things.

932
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:16,033
They have a way that you can
customize the chromeless player

933
00:34:16,033 --> 00:34:17,968
and then put it
on your site I think.

934
00:34:17,968 --> 00:34:19,601
So they have, like, a bunch
of skins you can choose.

935
00:34:19,601 --> 00:34:22,534
I like this one 'cause
it's got lots of bling.

936
00:34:22,534 --> 00:34:25,200
Then you can, like,
pick a video you want.

937
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,667
And it basically
looks like this,

938
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:28,000
so you can have, like,
a custom player,

939
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,667
and it plays
in their player.

940
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:31,400
Whoops, this actually
makes you save it

941
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:35,767
before you can play it.

942
00:34:35,767 --> 00:34:39,734
No, skip.

943
00:34:39,734 --> 00:34:42,167
So here's my video,
and then I can hit play.

944
00:34:42,167 --> 00:34:46,267
[man singing, crowd cheering]

945
00:34:46,267 --> 00:34:49,100
Stearns: So that's about it
for that one.

946
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,734
Um, let's see.

947
00:34:50,734 --> 00:34:53,067
Here's another example
of someone

948
00:34:53,067 --> 00:34:56,133
who had made a custom UI

949
00:34:56,133 --> 00:34:59,634
using all Flash.

950
00:34:59,634 --> 00:35:02,133
So this is actually a SWF that
loads the chromeless player.

951
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:04,200
Again, sort of like
the JW FLV player.

952
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,534
And they have their own thing.

953
00:35:05,534 --> 00:35:06,934
So what they have
is they have it set up

954
00:35:06,934 --> 00:35:08,934
so you can actually pick
a YouTube user channel,

955
00:35:08,934 --> 00:35:12,400
or user favorites,
or playlist, or whatever,

956
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,501
and then put in, you know,
either the user name

957
00:35:14,501 --> 00:35:17,501
or maybe, like, a keyword,
I think, or something like that.

958
00:35:17,501 --> 00:35:19,234
And it'll actually make you
a player

959
00:35:19,234 --> 00:35:20,400
that you can embed
on your site.

960
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,601
And then that player
will play, like,

961
00:35:21,601 --> 00:35:22,834
all your favorite videos,

962
00:35:22,834 --> 00:35:24,367
or a specific user's videos
if you want.

963
00:35:24,367 --> 00:35:25,467
So it's kinda cool.

964
00:35:25,467 --> 00:35:26,834
So these are, like,
playing videos

965
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:28,834
from Big Cat Rescue.

966
00:35:28,834 --> 00:35:30,534
One time I was showing this
at a talk,

967
00:35:30,534 --> 00:35:32,067
and there was a video
of a tiger

968
00:35:32,067 --> 00:35:33,901
carrying around
a severed cow head.

969
00:35:33,901 --> 00:35:35,234
And it was really gross.

970
00:35:35,234 --> 00:35:36,601
[laughter]

971
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:38,300
I just thought I would
share that with you guys.

972
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:41,033
woman: Like any youngster,
Hope just had to show off--

973
00:35:41,033 --> 00:35:42,601
Stearns: That didn't look
like a big cat.

974
00:35:42,601 --> 00:35:43,901
That looked
like a house cat.

975
00:35:43,901 --> 00:35:45,968
All right, anyway,
one more quick thing.

976
00:35:45,968 --> 00:35:47,834
This one was done by a guy
I used to work with

977
00:35:47,834 --> 00:35:49,801
that I thought
was kinda neat.

978
00:35:49,801 --> 00:35:52,300
There's a whole sort of--

979
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:57,100
Whoops, why is that there?

980
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:01,734
So there's this whole sort of,

981
00:36:01,734 --> 00:36:03,834
uh, sort of subculture
on YouTube, I guess,

982
00:36:03,834 --> 00:36:07,300
that videotape records
and 45s and things.

983
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,334
They put a camera and point it
at their 45 and play it.

984
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:10,701
So they have, like,
all this really cool, old,

985
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:12,601
like, reggae, and ska music,
and stuff.

986
00:36:12,601 --> 00:36:13,667
[cat meows]

987
00:36:13,667 --> 00:36:15,634
And apparently cats meowing.

988
00:36:15,634 --> 00:36:17,300
I guess that's
on the record.

989
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,133
So he set this up so it's
sort of like a little,

990
00:36:19,133 --> 00:36:21,501
like, a jukebox thing
where it'll play one thing.

991
00:36:21,501 --> 00:36:23,400
And then when this is done,
it'll start playing

992
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,133
the other one automatically
and then load a new video.

993
00:36:25,133 --> 00:36:26,734
And there's a few
different users where, like,

994
00:36:26,734 --> 00:36:28,534
all their videos
are just this stuff.

995
00:36:28,534 --> 00:36:30,033
So you can just pick
the username and then play it.

996
00:36:30,033 --> 00:36:31,834
I thought this
was kinda neat.

997
00:36:31,834 --> 00:36:35,033
And it uses, you know,
the volume.

998
00:36:35,033 --> 00:36:36,367
And if you don't like a song,

999
00:36:36,367 --> 00:36:38,000
you can just start playing
this one.

1000
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,200
And then when this one
starts playing,

1001
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,767
the other ones stops and--

1002
00:36:41,767 --> 00:36:43,567
I don't know,
it's kinda neat.

1003
00:36:43,567 --> 00:36:46,801
Really simple,
but interesting, I thought.

1004
00:36:46,801 --> 00:36:48,767
Um, all right,
so that's it.

1005
00:36:48,767 --> 00:36:50,968
So I was gonna do
a demo here really quick

1006
00:36:50,968 --> 00:36:52,934
of the JavaScript stuff,
but I think I went over it all.

1007
00:36:52,934 --> 00:36:56,834
So why don't we just jump
right to questions.

1008
00:36:56,834 --> 00:36:59,300
And then if you guys
have questions

1009
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,834
about the JavaScript stuff,
I can answer them

1010
00:37:01,834 --> 00:37:03,367
and sort of
do the demo that way.

1011
00:37:03,367 --> 00:37:04,601
Question over here, yeah?

1012
00:37:04,601 --> 00:37:06,133
man: Sorry, I have
a JavaScript question.

1013
00:37:06,133 --> 00:37:07,300
Stearns: Oh, no problem.

1014
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,133
man: I've seen some examples

1015
00:37:09,133 --> 00:37:11,534
of people putting
their own logos on the videos,

1016
00:37:11,534 --> 00:37:13,834
which I imagine is somewhat
of a sensitive topic.

1017
00:37:13,834 --> 00:37:17,400
What's the Google policy
on that?

1018
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,267
Stearns: Um, so disclaimer.

1019
00:37:19,267 --> 00:37:20,667
I'm not a lawyer, obviously.

1020
00:37:20,667 --> 00:37:24,667
But, uh, if you're using
the chromeless player,

1021
00:37:24,667 --> 00:37:26,267
it's gonna have
our logo on it.

1022
00:37:26,267 --> 00:37:27,834
Or the embedded player's
gonna have our logo on it.

1023
00:37:27,834 --> 00:37:29,434
So usually if you see somebody
that's using that

1024
00:37:29,434 --> 00:37:30,834
with their own logo,
they're probably not using

1025
00:37:30,834 --> 00:37:32,000
one of our players.

1026
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,501
So it's, like,
totally unsupported

1027
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:34,834
by our terms of service,

1028
00:37:34,834 --> 00:37:36,901
and it's a violation of
our terms of service, I believe.

1029
00:37:36,901 --> 00:37:38,400
You know, unless they have
some special arrangement.

1030
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,901
But to my knowledge,
I don't think we even do

1031
00:37:39,901 --> 00:37:41,634
special arrangements
like that.

1032
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:45,167
So it's probably way bad.

1033
00:37:45,167 --> 00:37:47,033
Don't do it.

1034
00:37:47,033 --> 00:37:48,968
Any other questions?

1035
00:37:48,968 --> 00:37:50,834
In the very far back there,
yeah?

1036
00:37:50,834 --> 00:37:55,567
[man speaking indistinctly]

1037
00:37:55,567 --> 00:37:57,734
Stearns: So the question is what
kind of control do you have

1038
00:37:57,734 --> 00:37:59,300
over the bit rate the videos
are encoded at?

1039
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,300
And the answer
is absolutely none.

1040
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,200
YouTube encodes them
at our own bit rate,

1041
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,634
so whatever we want
when the user uploads it.

1042
00:38:06,634 --> 00:38:08,434
If you look at
the YouTube site lately,

1043
00:38:08,434 --> 00:38:10,100
you'll notice that we do have
on some videos

1044
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,000
a high quality mode.

1045
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,868
So you can actually watch them
at a higher quality.

1046
00:38:13,868 --> 00:38:16,501
So I think the default size
is somewhere around

1047
00:38:16,501 --> 00:38:19,667
320x240 for, like, the small,
classic sort of YouTube sizes.

1048
00:38:19,667 --> 00:38:21,734
And then we have
bigger sizes from there.

1049
00:38:21,734 --> 00:38:23,968
And then you'll see different
sort of bigger quality stuff

1050
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,901
on, like, iPhones
and Apple TVs and things.

1051
00:38:25,901 --> 00:38:27,934
But we don't, I believe,
don't give access to those

1052
00:38:27,934 --> 00:38:29,868
in the API stuff.

1053
00:38:29,868 --> 00:38:31,501
So at some point
down the road,

1054
00:38:31,501 --> 00:38:33,267
we will be adding high quality
to the embedded players,

1055
00:38:33,267 --> 00:38:34,801
but it's a matter
of seeing the feature

1056
00:38:34,801 --> 00:38:36,601
mature and stabilize
on the site first

1057
00:38:36,601 --> 00:38:38,734
before that happens.

1058
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:41,100
The thing is that when we add
new features on the site,

1059
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,601
we have to let them
sort of settle in.

1060
00:38:42,601 --> 00:38:44,033
'Cause if we add them
to the embedded player

1061
00:38:44,033 --> 00:38:45,467
and add them to the API,

1062
00:38:45,467 --> 00:38:47,467
then you guys get really mad
if we ever change them, right?

1063
00:38:47,467 --> 00:38:48,868
So we want them to be solid

1064
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,400
before we push them
out to you guys

1065
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,234
and you guys
start using them.

1066
00:38:52,234 --> 00:38:54,033
Any other questions?

1067
00:38:54,033 --> 00:38:55,968
Yeah, green shirt I think
had his hand up first.

1068
00:38:55,968 --> 00:38:59,000
man: So what's the policy
on displaying

1069
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,534
in-video advertisements
embedded in--

1070
00:39:01,534 --> 00:39:03,000
Stearns: So the question is

1071
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,334
what's the policy on embedded--
putting in-video advertising

1072
00:39:05,334 --> 00:39:06,667
on the players?

1073
00:39:06,667 --> 00:39:09,367
And I believe
it's totally forbidden.

1074
00:39:09,367 --> 00:39:10,634
man: So--

1075
00:39:10,634 --> 00:39:12,767
Stearns: You mean our policy
or can you do it?

1076
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,033
man: No, your policy.

1077
00:39:14,033 --> 00:39:15,567
Stearns: Our policy.

1078
00:39:15,567 --> 00:39:19,200
I think we may at some point.

1079
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,501
So I guess--I suppose
we reserve the right.

1080
00:39:21,501 --> 00:39:22,667
I think it's in the terms.

1081
00:39:22,667 --> 00:39:24,000
Nickeal could probably
answer that question

1082
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,834
if you guys want to ask him
specific stuff.

1083
00:39:25,834 --> 00:39:27,367
And his talk's actually next.

1084
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:28,968
And he'll be able to sort of
explain the terms of service

1085
00:39:28,968 --> 00:39:31,767
and give you some better--
Maybe?

1086
00:39:31,767 --> 00:39:33,634
No?

1087
00:39:33,634 --> 00:39:37,234
Nickeal's not a lawyer,
but he can--

1088
00:39:37,234 --> 00:39:39,367
But he knows it really well.

1089
00:39:39,367 --> 00:39:42,234
So feel free to ask him,
unless there's somebody better.

1090
00:39:42,234 --> 00:39:43,701
Is there anybody better
that's here?

1091
00:39:43,701 --> 00:39:45,100
No.
Nikeal's your man.

1092
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:49,234
Nikeal's your man.
Go ask him.

1093
00:39:49,234 --> 00:39:50,634
Next question.

1094
00:39:50,634 --> 00:39:52,834
Uh, I don't know which one
was you first?

1095
00:39:52,834 --> 00:39:54,234
All right, go ahead.

1096
00:39:54,234 --> 00:39:56,167
man: Um, with a lot
of your examples

1097
00:39:56,167 --> 00:39:57,701
you showed exactly
what I was looking for

1098
00:39:57,701 --> 00:40:00,467
which was the time-based events.

1099
00:40:00,467 --> 00:40:04,701
If the key frame is not there,
is it still accurate such that--

1100
00:40:04,701 --> 00:40:06,767
I don't care
if there's a key frame or not.

1101
00:40:06,767 --> 00:40:09,667
But I do care that if
when I'm listening to it

1102
00:40:09,667 --> 00:40:11,067
that it tells the right time.

1103
00:40:11,067 --> 00:40:12,534
Stearns: Uh, it does.

1104
00:40:12,534 --> 00:40:14,601
So if you seek to 15
and it goes to 10,

1105
00:40:14,601 --> 00:40:16,634
it'll tell you
that it's at 10.

1106
00:40:16,634 --> 00:40:19,234
man: But if I'm listening
to see where it's at,

1107
00:40:19,234 --> 00:40:22,934
will I be told it's at ten
because there's no key frame?

1108
00:40:22,934 --> 00:40:25,367
Stearns: Um, you will--

1109
00:40:25,367 --> 00:40:27,567
Well, you're basically told

1110
00:40:27,567 --> 00:40:29,367
exactly where it's at.

1111
00:40:29,367 --> 00:40:31,167
So, like, whatever you're
seeing on the video

1112
00:40:31,167 --> 00:40:34,000
and whatever time that is,
that's what time the API says.

1113
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,501
So if you tell it
to go to 15,

1114
00:40:35,501 --> 00:40:36,834
and there's
no key frame at 15,

1115
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:38,334
but there is
a key frame at 12,

1116
00:40:38,334 --> 00:40:40,000
the player goes to 12
and the API tells you

1117
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,567
that it went to 12.

1118
00:40:41,567 --> 00:40:43,701
man: And thus going forward
I'll know it's at 13, 14, 15?

1119
00:40:43,701 --> 00:40:44,868
Stearns: Right, right, right.

1120
00:40:44,868 --> 00:40:46,367
And then it goes up
from there as it goes.

1121
00:40:46,367 --> 00:40:47,367
Uh, yeah?

1122
00:40:47,367 --> 00:40:48,567
man: So I'm having problems

1123
00:40:48,567 --> 00:40:51,167
resizing the YouTube player
in Flash.

1124
00:40:51,167 --> 00:40:52,334
Stearns: Okay.

1125
00:40:52,334 --> 00:40:54,000
man: And I'm not sure exactly

1126
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,200
when you're supposed
to do it.

1127
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,667
[continues indistinctly]

1128
00:40:58,667 --> 00:41:00,200
Stearns: So I think there was
a bug about this

1129
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,601
that I was tracking.

1130
00:41:01,601 --> 00:41:03,567
Are you the one that posted that
on the forum actually?

1131
00:41:03,567 --> 00:41:04,701
Somebody posted it.

1132
00:41:04,701 --> 00:41:06,133
The thing is
is that if you set up--

1133
00:41:06,133 --> 00:41:08,000
There was a bug in the player
where if you set an interval

1134
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,067
to pull the player too often,
it was basically saying

1135
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:12,167
it was ready before
it was actually ready.

1136
00:41:12,167 --> 00:41:14,300
man: Your example
was every two--

1137
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,200
Stearns: Right,
I think in Flash

1138
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,267
my example code was using
an on enter frame event,

1139
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:20,701
and I think I was using, like,
31 frames per second or so.

1140
00:41:20,701 --> 00:41:22,734
And that was okay for me,
and I never saw the bug.

1141
00:41:22,734 --> 00:41:24,300
But I was able
to reproduce it,

1142
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,901
and I think
I just fixed it yesterday.

1143
00:41:25,901 --> 00:41:29,367
So you'll probably see it
in a push next week probably.

1144
00:41:29,367 --> 00:41:30,734
So it should be fixed
next week.

1145
00:41:30,734 --> 00:41:32,167
And then you should be able--
as soon as you call--

1146
00:41:32,167 --> 00:41:33,834
As soon as the player's ready
you can call set size,

1147
00:41:33,834 --> 00:41:35,567
and it'll work.

1148
00:41:35,567 --> 00:41:37,834
Uh, another question
over here maybe?

1149
00:41:37,834 --> 00:41:40,133
man: Question,
with the chromeless player,

1150
00:41:40,133 --> 00:41:43,434
the whole video frame
becomes effectively a button.

1151
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:45,601
You can click there
and it'll launch YouTube

1152
00:41:45,601 --> 00:41:47,234
to that video's homepage.

1153
00:41:47,234 --> 00:41:48,701
>> Stearns: Right.

1154
00:41:48,701 --> 00:41:50,334
man: My question, is there a way
to disable that or change that?

1155
00:41:50,334 --> 00:41:51,834
Stearns: No,
and I think it's part

1156
00:41:51,834 --> 00:41:53,234
of the terms of service
is that you have to have

1157
00:41:53,234 --> 00:41:54,467
a link back to YouTube.

1158
00:41:54,467 --> 00:41:55,834
So I think that's why
that's there.

1159
00:41:55,834 --> 00:41:57,200
man: All right, so I think

1160
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,033
the following question
will probably be "no" as well.

1161
00:41:59,033 --> 00:42:02,033
But in the sharing menus,

1162
00:42:02,033 --> 00:42:04,033
the event code
could be link.

1163
00:42:04,033 --> 00:42:07,467
There's no way to control
the Google to that URL is there?

1164
00:42:07,467 --> 00:42:08,734
It's always back to YouTube.

1165
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:10,501
Stearns: Yeah, it always goes
back to YouTube.

1166
00:42:10,501 --> 00:42:11,767
If you use
the chromeless player though,

1167
00:42:11,767 --> 00:42:12,968
it doesn't even have that.

1168
00:42:12,968 --> 00:42:14,734
So you could in theory
build your own link.

1169
00:42:14,734 --> 00:42:16,567
Like, in fact that
Rock Your Look site,

1170
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:18,434
they actually when you get
a link to a video,

1171
00:42:18,434 --> 00:42:20,334
it gives you the link
to the Rock Your Look site

1172
00:42:20,334 --> 00:42:21,901
to the specific video
you were watching,

1173
00:42:21,901 --> 00:42:23,734
not to YouTube.

1174
00:42:23,734 --> 00:42:25,434
Uh, another question?

1175
00:42:25,434 --> 00:42:27,534
[man speaking indistinctly]

1176
00:42:34,534 --> 00:42:36,901
Stearns: Yeah, okay.

1177
00:42:36,901 --> 00:42:40,868
As long as you're, you know,
nice to us, it's cool.

1178
00:42:40,868 --> 00:42:43,067
There was another question
back there I think, yeah?

1179
00:42:43,067 --> 00:42:44,434
man: Yeah, are there any plans

1180
00:42:44,434 --> 00:42:46,400
for an ActionScript 3 player--

1181
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,534
Stearns: Um, yes, but it's
probably still some time away.

1182
00:42:49,534 --> 00:42:53,133
man: What's that next version
of ActionScript?

1183
00:42:53,133 --> 00:42:57,367
[continues indistinctly]

1184
00:42:57,367 --> 00:42:59,801
Stearns: Yeah, ActionScript 3
is, like, the latest version.

1185
00:42:59,801 --> 00:43:02,234
It's a different--
it's not compatible with AS 2,

1186
00:43:02,234 --> 00:43:04,234
which is what our players
are written in.

1187
00:43:04,234 --> 00:43:06,133
So you have to have
a new version.

1188
00:43:06,133 --> 00:43:08,367
Any more questions?

1189
00:43:08,367 --> 00:43:10,634
Do you guys wanna watch
more Billoon videos?

1190
00:43:10,634 --> 00:43:11,834
[laughter]

1191
00:43:11,834 --> 00:43:14,067
There's a question
in the back there.

1192
00:43:14,067 --> 00:43:17,400
man:
Question on the frame size.

1193
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,767
When we upload a video
that is set in wide-screen,

1194
00:43:21,767 --> 00:43:27,567
can we, in the chromeless,
show that in its true size?

1195
00:43:27,567 --> 00:43:30,300
Stearns: Um, you can.

1196
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:31,701
Um.

1197
00:43:31,701 --> 00:43:34,300
It's a recent thing
where YouTube

1198
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:36,634
used to force all videos
to be 4x3.

1199
00:43:36,634 --> 00:43:38,701
And I believe there's been
a recent change

1200
00:43:38,701 --> 00:43:40,067
to where we don't
do that anymore,

1201
00:43:40,067 --> 00:43:41,434
but I don't know
if it's every video

1202
00:43:41,434 --> 00:43:43,634
or only, like,
certain popular videos.

1203
00:43:43,634 --> 00:43:44,934
I'm not exactly sure.

1204
00:43:44,934 --> 00:43:46,601
We are moving
in that direction though.

1205
00:43:46,601 --> 00:43:48,200
So very soon,
if not already,

1206
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,033
you will be able
to upload, like,

1207
00:43:50,033 --> 00:43:52,501
a 16x9 video and it'll stay
at whatever aspect ratio

1208
00:43:52,501 --> 00:43:54,067
you upload it at.

1209
00:43:54,067 --> 00:43:56,100
So the players,
including the embedded player

1210
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,167
and the chromeless player,
are set up in a way

1211
00:43:58,167 --> 00:44:00,601
that you basically set
the viewport size,

1212
00:44:00,601 --> 00:44:03,267
and then the video,
no matter what the aspect ratio

1213
00:44:03,267 --> 00:44:05,133
of the video is,
it just tries to fill up

1214
00:44:05,133 --> 00:44:07,467
as much of the space
that you give it as possible.

1215
00:44:07,467 --> 00:44:09,234
So if, like, the video is--

1216
00:44:09,234 --> 00:44:10,734
If you set
the chromeless player

1217
00:44:10,734 --> 00:44:12,667
to be 16x9
and the video is 4x3,

1218
00:44:12,667 --> 00:44:14,267
you'll just automatically
get black bars

1219
00:44:14,267 --> 00:44:16,234
on the left and right side.

1220
00:44:16,234 --> 00:44:17,501
Same thing if it's, like,
you know,

1221
00:44:17,501 --> 00:44:18,901
a really tall
and skinny video.

1222
00:44:18,901 --> 00:44:20,868
You'll get black bars
on the, you know, the side.

1223
00:44:20,868 --> 00:44:22,868
I should say bars on the top
and bottom, I guess.

1224
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:24,734
Or, yeah.
You guys know what I mean.

1225
00:44:24,734 --> 00:44:26,167
Another question.

1226
00:44:26,167 --> 00:44:27,901
man: The videos that were
uploaded, say,

1227
00:44:27,901 --> 00:44:32,834
six months ago have
the resolution of DVD encoding?

1228
00:44:32,834 --> 00:44:35,400
Stearns: Um, they may be,
but I don't know.

1229
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,200
We have a lot of videos,
so it could take a while.

1230
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,534
Um, but it's something
that I would like to do.

1231
00:44:41,534 --> 00:44:44,934
So it could take a while,
but, yes.

1232
00:44:44,934 --> 00:44:46,868
Another one in the back?

1233
00:44:46,868 --> 00:44:49,801
[man speaking indistinctly]

1234
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:58,334
Stearns: Uh, that's a good
question, and I don't know.

1235
00:44:58,334 --> 00:45:00,133
Um...

1236
00:45:00,133 --> 00:45:01,801
Oh, so the question was that--

1237
00:45:01,801 --> 00:45:05,033
Do all of the videos get encoded
at the same bit rate,

1238
00:45:05,033 --> 00:45:07,300
or do we sort of sense
the quality of the video

1239
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,100
and then encode it
at a lower bit rate?

1240
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:11,467
Um, I think that
for the high-quality stuff

1241
00:45:11,467 --> 00:45:13,167
we sort of check and see
if the video

1242
00:45:13,167 --> 00:45:15,300
would actually benefit
from being high-quality.

1243
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:17,234
Like, if somebody uploads
a crappy source version,

1244
00:45:17,234 --> 00:45:19,434
we might not waste time making
a high-quality version of it,

1245
00:45:19,434 --> 00:45:21,033
'cause it wouldn't really help.

1246
00:45:21,033 --> 00:45:23,501
But I think, like,
the standard, you know,

1247
00:45:23,501 --> 00:45:25,868
320x240 size,
I'm not actually sure

1248
00:45:25,868 --> 00:45:28,868
if it's a standard bit rate
for all of them.

1249
00:45:28,868 --> 00:45:31,300
It might be a good question
to ask--

1250
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:33,167
Actually, I don't know
who would know that.

1251
00:45:33,167 --> 00:45:35,400
Probably some of the engineers.
Which one?

1252
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,167
You think John?
Yeah, John would know.

1253
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:38,467
If you see John Harding
out front,

1254
00:45:38,467 --> 00:45:41,400
the guy that did the talk first,
he may know that.

1255
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,133
Um, any other questions?

1256
00:45:45,133 --> 00:45:46,901
Last chance.

1257
00:45:46,901 --> 00:45:49,767
Okay, I will be around,
in the lobby probably,

1258
00:45:49,767 --> 00:45:51,868
for the rest of the time.

1259
00:45:51,868 --> 00:45:54,701
I think we have a break
right now for about 15--

1260
00:45:54,701 --> 00:45:57,100
19 minutes or something,
'cause we're stopping

1261
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:58,901
a little bit early,
so feel free to wander out.

1262
00:45:58,901 --> 00:46:00,167
Go to the bathroom.
Get a snack.

1263
00:46:00,167 --> 00:46:01,734
Uh, thanks for coming.

1264
00:46:01,734 --> 00:46:04,467
[applause]
