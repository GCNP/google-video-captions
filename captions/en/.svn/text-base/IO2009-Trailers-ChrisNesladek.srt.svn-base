00:00:04,033 --> 00:00:05,501
Hi, I'm Chris Nesladek,

2
00:00:05,501 --> 00:00:07,534
and I'm speaking
at Google I/O this year.

3
00:00:07,534 --> 00:00:09,901
The topic of my presentation
is entitled

4
00:00:09,901 --> 00:00:14,501
"How to Marry Interaction and
Visual Design the Android Way."

5
00:00:14,501 --> 00:00:17,167
We've been really busy
working on Cupcake this year,

6
00:00:17,167 --> 00:00:20,501
and our UI guidelines aren't
quite ready for distribution.

7
00:00:20,501 --> 00:00:22,534
However,
if you come to this talk,

8
00:00:22,534 --> 00:00:24,667
you'll learn
how to think like a designer,

9
00:00:24,667 --> 00:00:26,834
not to mention
learn how to use

10
00:00:26,834 --> 00:00:28,868
the templates,
assets, and behaviors

11
00:00:28,868 --> 00:00:30,534
that we built
into the new framework.

12
00:00:30,534 --> 00:00:33,133
So how are you going
to learn to be a designer?

13
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:35,167
Well, I'm going to teach you

14
00:00:35,167 --> 00:00:37,400
the three pillars
of interaction design:

15
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,968
you're going to learn
about structure,

16
00:00:38,968 --> 00:00:40,434
you're going to learn
about behavior,

17
00:00:40,434 --> 00:00:43,133
and you're going to learn
a little bit about expression.

18
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:45,167
Let's take a look
at an example.

19
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,734
Here in the new Gmail,

20
00:00:48,734 --> 00:00:50,400
the structure
is fairly established

21
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,534
where you can see that you
can select a message,

22
00:00:53,534 --> 00:00:56,067
view that message,
or star it.

23
00:00:56,067 --> 00:00:59,200
Now, if I actually choose
to select a message,

24
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,434
the behavior that's
associated with that

25
00:01:01,434 --> 00:01:04,968
by tapping the check box
is a button bar.

26
00:01:04,968 --> 00:01:07,300
It comes up from the bottom
and allows the user

27
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,167
the ability to archive,
label, or delete

28
00:01:10,167 --> 00:01:11,534
the messages
they have chosen.

29
00:01:11,534 --> 00:01:13,367
What ties this all together

30
00:01:13,367 --> 00:01:14,901
is the expression layer.

31
00:01:14,901 --> 00:01:16,868
The expression layer
tells me

32
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,634
that the three zones that
I've established as a designer

33
00:01:19,634 --> 00:01:21,467
are available
to a user

34
00:01:21,467 --> 00:01:24,567
through the use
of check boxes,

35
00:01:24,567 --> 00:01:26,167
a standard list view
button element,

36
00:01:26,167 --> 00:01:29,934
as well as
a "Favorites" star.

37
00:01:29,934 --> 00:01:32,667
I hope you'll join me
May 27th and 28th

38
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:33,868
in San Francisco

39
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:35,634
where you'll learn
to be a designer,

40
00:01:35,634 --> 00:01:37,167
just like this.

41
00:01:37,167 --> 00:01:39,334
 Well...at least for a day.
