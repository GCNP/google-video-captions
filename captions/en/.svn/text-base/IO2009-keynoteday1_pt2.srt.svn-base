1
00:00:04,634 --> 00:00:05,901
man:
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:05,901 --> 00:00:08,267
please welcome Chief Executive
Officer of Google,

3
00:00:08,267 --> 00:00:10,834
Dr. Eric Schmidt.

4
00:00:10,834 --> 00:00:11,934
Schmidt: Thank you.

5
00:00:11,934 --> 00:00:15,133
[applause]

6
00:00:15,133 --> 00:00:17,234
Thank you all.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
First let me start
by welcoming everybody.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,400
Many of you traveled
a long distance

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,634
to come here
to, uh, spend two days with us

10
00:00:26,634 --> 00:00:28,968
to talk about the thing
I like the most,

11
00:00:28,968 --> 00:00:30,901
which is programming.

12
00:00:30,901 --> 00:00:34,300
And let me tell you
that it's time.

13
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,501
It's time for us
to take advantage

14
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:40,067
of the amazing opportunity
that is before us.

15
00:00:40,067 --> 00:00:41,334
And that's what I want
to talk about

16
00:00:41,334 --> 00:00:43,367
for just a few minutes.

17
00:00:43,367 --> 00:00:44,767
Today and tomorrow,

18
00:00:44,767 --> 00:00:47,033
you're going to have interesting
product announcements,

19
00:00:47,033 --> 00:00:50,200
some fun stuff,
and perhaps most important,

20
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,667
you're gonna spend time

21
00:00:51,667 --> 00:00:53,567
with the best programmers
in the world

22
00:00:53,567 --> 00:00:54,701
who are here in the room.

23
00:00:54,701 --> 00:00:55,934
Literally you all.

24
00:00:55,934 --> 00:00:58,601
And we're very excited
to have you here.

25
00:00:58,601 --> 00:01:02,334
Uh, from my perspective,
it's time.

26
00:01:02,334 --> 00:01:04,934
We have spent 20 years

27
00:01:04,934 --> 00:01:08,834
trying to build
a programming model

28
00:01:08,834 --> 00:01:10,467
that's the right one.

29
00:01:10,467 --> 00:01:11,968
We started
with the mainframe model.

30
00:01:11,968 --> 00:01:13,467
Then we moved
to the PC model.

31
00:01:13,467 --> 00:01:17,567
And it had brilliant parts
and very frustrating parts.

32
00:01:17,567 --> 00:01:19,434
And then
the internet arrived.

33
00:01:19,434 --> 00:01:21,067
And internet programming.

34
00:01:21,067 --> 00:01:23,334
The way we think
about it now

35
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:24,901
is something
we have all worked on

36
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:26,634
for all of our career.

37
00:01:26,634 --> 00:01:28,167
It's time.

38
00:01:28,167 --> 00:01:29,567
Why is it time?

39
00:01:29,567 --> 00:01:32,367
We finally now have
the networks,

40
00:01:32,367 --> 00:01:35,133
the businesses,
the programmers,

41
00:01:35,133 --> 00:01:36,968
the programming tools,

42
00:01:36,968 --> 00:01:39,234
that can build
the kind of platforms

43
00:01:39,234 --> 00:01:43,834
and the kind of opportunities
that I want to highlight.

44
00:01:43,834 --> 00:01:45,868
Today and tomorrow,
you're going to hear a lot

45
00:01:45,868 --> 00:01:48,601
about some
of the Google technologies

46
00:01:48,601 --> 00:01:50,100
many of you,
you--you are already using.

47
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,567
For example,
Google Web--Web Toolkit.

48
00:01:51,567 --> 00:01:52,834
You know, we used
to say "write once,

49
00:01:52,834 --> 00:01:54,934
run anywhere with Java"
back in my old--

50
00:01:54,934 --> 00:01:56,400
in my old job.

51
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,501
Now it's write "write once,
run on any browser," right?

52
00:01:59,501 --> 00:02:01,701
Uh, because the browsers
have become so complicated.

53
00:02:01,701 --> 00:02:04,033
That's what GWT
is all about.

54
00:02:04,033 --> 00:02:05,701
We're going to see
a lot more things

55
00:02:05,701 --> 00:02:07,968
about a product
called App Engine,

56
00:02:07,968 --> 00:02:09,601
which now today includes,
by the way,

57
00:02:09,601 --> 00:02:11,667
support for Java, right,
which is great,

58
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:13,868
and more,
presumably, coming.

59
00:02:13,868 --> 00:02:18,434
The notion of these platforms
as powerful platforms

60
00:02:18,434 --> 00:02:21,567
are part of a story
that's been true forever.

61
00:02:21,567 --> 00:02:24,701
And it's a story that innovation
always occurs elsewhere.

62
00:02:24,701 --> 00:02:27,501
It never is in the little world
that I sit in

63
00:02:27,501 --> 00:02:28,501
or that you sit in.

64
00:02:28,501 --> 00:02:30,167
It's always somewhere else.

65
00:02:30,167 --> 00:02:33,567
There's always a programmer,
an inventor,

66
00:02:33,567 --> 00:02:35,400
a brilliant person

67
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,501
who's somewhere other than
where you are.

68
00:02:37,501 --> 00:02:40,000
They need to use a platform
that you build.

69
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,501
They need, for example,
to be able to use a platform

70
00:02:42,501 --> 00:02:44,667
even if they don't
speak English

71
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:46,400
and even if they don't
really understand

72
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,367
some of the other things
that you've done,

73
00:02:48,367 --> 00:02:51,968
but because they have an idea
and they have a vision.

74
00:02:51,968 --> 00:02:53,801
And maybe they use
the wrong operating system

75
00:02:53,801 --> 00:02:54,968
or they have
the wrong background

76
00:02:54,968 --> 00:02:56,234
or whatever,

77
00:02:56,234 --> 00:02:57,901
but they're clever
and they're smart.

78
00:02:57,901 --> 00:02:59,734
And that's
how innovation occurs.

79
00:02:59,734 --> 00:03:03,267
It's always been true
and it will always be true.

80
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:05,667
And that's why
we're here today.

81
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:07,667
Maybe you're here
to talk about Android

82
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:09,834
and some of the things
that we're doing there.

83
00:03:09,834 --> 00:03:12,267
Android looks like it's going
to have a very strong year.

84
00:03:12,267 --> 00:03:14,167
Not only do we have
many thousands

85
00:03:14,167 --> 00:03:15,300
of applications now

86
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,567
as part of our Android
application store,

87
00:03:17,567 --> 00:03:19,400
but we also have
many hardware partners

88
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,868
that are coming along

89
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:23,100
to build innovative
new hardware platforms

90
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,234
which look like phones,

91
00:03:24,234 --> 00:03:25,601
but do a lot of things

92
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:28,200
that--that are not
normally associated with phones.

93
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,300
Again, the innovation cycle
continues.

94
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,100
So what we want you to do
is we want you here

95
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,734
to spend your time
with our teams and vice versa

96
00:03:37,734 --> 00:03:39,434
and yourselves
with each other

97
00:03:39,434 --> 00:03:42,634
to try to figure out
what we can do now.

98
00:03:42,634 --> 00:03:45,000
So why is it time?
Why is it time?

99
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,133
Why is it time
to take the challenge?

100
00:03:47,133 --> 00:03:49,033
Because people
are frustrated.

101
00:03:49,033 --> 00:03:50,701
They're tired
of the complexity

102
00:03:50,701 --> 00:03:52,334
of all of the systems
that have been built up

103
00:03:52,334 --> 00:03:54,334
over the last 10, 20 years.

104
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:55,734
They don't work that well.

105
00:03:55,734 --> 00:03:57,501
Where's the "it works"
option?

106
00:03:57,501 --> 00:04:00,434
Where's the button where it
just installs and works?

107
00:04:00,434 --> 00:04:03,634
Why do we keep adding complexity
after complexity in our--

108
00:04:03,634 --> 00:04:04,968
in our world?

109
00:04:04,968 --> 00:04:08,334
Well, here's an opportunity
using Ajax programming,

110
00:04:08,334 --> 00:04:09,834
the new programming
languages,

111
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:12,033
the new programming paradigm
that we're going to talk about

112
00:04:12,033 --> 00:04:15,968
in the next couple of days
to build another step higher.

113
00:04:15,968 --> 00:04:18,934
To bring another level
of functionality

114
00:04:18,934 --> 00:04:23,334
that ultimately means power
can generate simplicity

115
00:04:23,334 --> 00:04:25,033
and ultimately
make these systems

116
00:04:25,033 --> 00:04:26,901
simpler and easier to use

117
00:04:26,901 --> 00:04:29,834
by the people we serve
who are not programmers.

118
00:04:29,834 --> 00:04:31,434
They're not computer
scientists.

119
00:04:31,434 --> 00:04:33,534
They're not engineers.

120
00:04:33,534 --> 00:04:34,834
I'm one of these people
who believes

121
00:04:34,834 --> 00:04:35,834
that computer science

122
00:04:35,834 --> 00:04:37,801
is at the center
of the universe.

123
00:04:37,801 --> 00:04:39,167
I'm one of these people
who believes

124
00:04:39,167 --> 00:04:44,100
that what we do as scientists,
as programmers,

125
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,567
as people who care
about making the world

126
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:46,934
a better place,

127
00:04:46,934 --> 00:04:48,334
can really scale.

128
00:04:48,334 --> 00:04:51,300
I'm a person who believes
that scalability

129
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,234
and the power as r--
as evidenced by the power

130
00:04:53,234 --> 00:04:55,901
of the internet
is just beginning.

131
00:04:55,901 --> 00:04:59,501
And I would tell you
that we're just at the beginning

132
00:04:59,501 --> 00:05:01,167
of getting this right.

133
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:03,434
When we talk
about cloud computing,

134
00:05:03,434 --> 00:05:05,801
we talk about all
the new kinds of devices,

135
00:05:05,801 --> 00:05:10,167
you're seeing a whole new set
of companies, ideas,

136
00:05:10,167 --> 00:05:12,234
product solutions,
competitors.

137
00:05:12,234 --> 00:05:15,501
All sorts of things all coming
from this shared vision

138
00:05:15,501 --> 00:05:17,567
around a new
programming model.

139
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,801
It's not the old
programming model

140
00:05:18,801 --> 00:05:20,601
where I was handed a book
and said program

141
00:05:20,601 --> 00:05:22,901
against these interfaces
against this standard OS

142
00:05:22,901 --> 00:05:25,067
and everything
will work locally.

143
00:05:25,067 --> 00:05:27,133
But it's a similar model

144
00:05:27,133 --> 00:05:29,868
where I can go pick
the very best

145
00:05:29,868 --> 00:05:31,133
of this code
and that code.

146
00:05:31,133 --> 00:05:33,400
Put it together.
Mash it if you will.

147
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,934
Have it automatically
compiled.

148
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:38,133
And have it deliver
tremendous performance

149
00:05:38,133 --> 00:05:39,634
for all of us.

150
00:05:39,634 --> 00:05:42,300
With this, we can take
the collective intelligence

151
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,567
of the internet,
which is astounding--

152
00:05:44,567 --> 00:05:47,167
all the information,
all those things going on--

153
00:05:47,167 --> 00:05:48,968
and do amazing things.

154
00:05:48,968 --> 00:05:51,167
We can tell people
what's going to happen.

155
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:52,767
We can tell people
what's happening nearby.

156
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,267
We can follow
what they care about.

157
00:05:55,267 --> 00:05:56,400
As you walk down the street,

158
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,000
we can tell them the history
of the buildings

159
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,467
as we walk along.

160
00:05:59,467 --> 00:06:02,868
We can do image recognition
to sort of see what's happening.

161
00:06:02,868 --> 00:06:06,734
All of these are applications
that someone in this room

162
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:08,734
has already built.

163
00:06:08,734 --> 00:06:11,400
All of you are busy building
the version 2

164
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,033
of all of those kinds
of things.

165
00:06:13,033 --> 00:06:14,767
It's phenomenal.

166
00:06:14,767 --> 00:06:17,934
So my message to you
is this is the beginning

167
00:06:17,934 --> 00:06:20,300
of the real win
of cloud computing.

168
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,801
Of the real win
of applications.

169
00:06:22,801 --> 00:06:24,634
Of the real win
of the internet,

170
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:27,434
which is changing
the computing paradigm--

171
00:06:27,434 --> 00:06:29,400
the one that we've all
grown up with--

172
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,801
so it just works.

173
00:06:30,801 --> 00:06:32,901
It works no matter what device
you're using,

174
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:34,901
whatever operating system
you're using,

175
00:06:34,901 --> 00:06:36,667
as long as you're connected--

176
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:39,234
and even if you're no--
offline with some caching,

177
00:06:39,234 --> 00:06:41,267
you're on and you have
everything you need.

178
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:44,667
That's the promise
of our new web computing model,

179
00:06:44,667 --> 00:06:46,400
which we're all
talking about.

180
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,667
We're going to show you
some amazing technology

181
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:50,367
and some amazing partnerships
that we've done

182
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,834
in the next hour and a half.

183
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:54,200
I'm delighted
that you're here

184
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,033
and I'm excited
about what we're doing.

185
00:06:56,033 --> 00:06:58,701
And I want to take a minute
to thank you for coming

186
00:06:58,701 --> 00:07:00,968
and also introduce
Vic Gundrota,

187
00:07:00,968 --> 00:07:02,534
who's the executive
who's in charge

188
00:07:02,534 --> 00:07:04,601
of all of our develop programs,
all of our mobile programs,

189
00:07:04,601 --> 00:07:05,868
and lots of our businesses.

190
00:07:05,868 --> 00:07:06,868
Vic, can you join me
on stage?

191
00:07:06,868 --> 00:07:08,100
Thank you very much.

192
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,834
Gundrota: Thank you, Eric.
Schmidt: Take care, Vic.

193
00:07:09,834 --> 00:07:11,267
Gundrota: Appreciate it.
Schmidt: Thanks.

194
00:07:11,267 --> 00:07:12,667
Gundrota: Thank you.
Schmidt: Thank you.

195
00:07:12,667 --> 00:07:16,100
[applause]

196
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,901
Gundrota: Thank you for those
opening comments, Eric.

197
00:07:17,901 --> 00:07:22,267
And good morning, everybody.
Welcome to I/O.

198
00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:25,534
Never underestimate the web.

199
00:07:25,534 --> 00:07:28,734
It's a mistake
that I once made.

200
00:07:28,734 --> 00:07:30,167
It was about a half
a decade ago

201
00:07:30,167 --> 00:07:33,834
and I was leading a team
at Microsoft responsible

202
00:07:33,834 --> 00:07:37,067
for driving the developer
adoption of Windows.

203
00:07:37,067 --> 00:07:39,801
Of course we had seen
the emergence of the web.

204
00:07:39,801 --> 00:07:45,300
But we argued that web apps
could never rival desktop apps.

205
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,400
In fact, our favorite
and our canonical example

206
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,968
was from a small Bay Area
company called Keyhole.

207
00:07:52,968 --> 00:07:54,801
Keyhole had made the fan--

208
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:57,667
most fantastic
geovisualization software

209
00:07:57,667 --> 00:07:58,934
for Windows.

210
00:07:58,934 --> 00:08:01,400
And it was exactly
that kind of software

211
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,534
that we argued
could never be done on the web.

212
00:08:05,534 --> 00:08:07,667
In November of 2004,

213
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:10,434
Google acquired
that small company

214
00:08:10,434 --> 00:08:13,968
and a few months later
released maps.google.com

215
00:08:13,968 --> 00:08:15,334
with satellite views.

216
00:08:15,334 --> 00:08:19,167
A web app
that simply left us stunned.

217
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:21,300
Maybe you remember
the first time you

218
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,467
from any browser
were able to zoom down

219
00:08:23,467 --> 00:08:25,300
into your own backyard.

220
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,467
You know, Google Apps--
Google Maps was amazing--

221
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:29,968
is amazing.

222
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:33,634
But what was even more important
was what that application

223
00:08:33,634 --> 00:08:35,234
was foretelling.

224
00:08:35,234 --> 00:08:37,033
That we would see
what we formerly thought

225
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:40,267
was impossible
become possible,

226
00:08:40,267 --> 00:08:42,934
even commonplace
in the browser.

227
00:08:42,934 --> 00:08:46,234
Yes, the web has won.

228
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:50,400
It has become the dominant
programming model of our time.

229
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,734
In many respects,
this conference, Google I/O,

230
00:08:52,734 --> 00:08:56,000
is about a celebration
of that open web platform.

231
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,667
And this morning,
I'd like to talk to you

232
00:08:57,667 --> 00:09:01,000
about the ongoing evolution
of--of the web.

233
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,200
Of making a more powerful web
made easier.

234
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,968
And this morning's keynote
is broken up

235
00:09:06,968 --> 00:09:08,868
into two broad sections.

236
00:09:08,868 --> 00:09:10,067
In the opening section,

237
00:09:10,067 --> 00:09:11,400
I'm going to show you,

238
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,734
uh, what's making the web
more powerful.

239
00:09:13,734 --> 00:09:16,467
Some new HTML 5 standards

240
00:09:16,467 --> 00:09:18,534
that are enabling us
to build applications

241
00:09:18,534 --> 00:09:21,300
that I think
will surprise users.

242
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,834
And in the second half
of the keynote,

243
00:09:23,834 --> 00:09:26,133
I'm going to highlight
some Google services

244
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:29,667
that we believe can help you,
uh, build those apps

245
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:30,767
much easier.

246
00:09:30,767 --> 00:09:33,434
So let's get started here.

247
00:09:33,434 --> 00:09:36,167
Let me find the clicker.

248
00:09:36,167 --> 00:09:38,267
You know, I think when you
look back over the last year--

249
00:09:38,267 --> 00:09:41,334
in fact, just the last
eight, nine months--

250
00:09:41,334 --> 00:09:43,334
you have to be amazed

251
00:09:43,334 --> 00:09:47,067
at the rate our web platform
is accelerating.

252
00:09:47,067 --> 00:09:48,901
It seems like almost
every other month,

253
00:09:48,901 --> 00:09:50,567
we've had a browser released

254
00:09:50,567 --> 00:09:53,167
even--either for the desktop
or for mobile.

255
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:55,167
And these new browsers
are not just faster--

256
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:57,000
I mean, of course
they're faster--

257
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,300
but even more importantly,

258
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,334
these browsers are incorporating
.NET new functionality

259
00:10:02,334 --> 00:10:05,601
that, frankly, I'm not sure
most developers know about.
