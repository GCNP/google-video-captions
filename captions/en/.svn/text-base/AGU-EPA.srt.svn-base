1
00:00:00,767 --> 00:00:02,033
Bailey: Okay, our next speaker

2
00:00:02,033 --> 00:00:03,801
is Phil Dickerson who works

3
00:00:03,801 --> 00:00:07,300
for The U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency,

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,367
and he's gonna
be talking about

5
00:00:09,367 --> 00:00:11,300
how they have been
using Google Earth

6
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:17,901
to visualize real-time
air quality data.

7
00:00:17,901 --> 00:00:19,367
Dickerson: Thanks, John.

8
00:00:19,367 --> 00:00:20,868
As John said,
I'm Phil Dickerson

9
00:00:20,868 --> 00:00:22,434
with The Environmental
Protection Agency,

10
00:00:22,434 --> 00:00:24,667
office of Air Quality,
Planning, and Standards,

11
00:00:24,667 --> 00:00:26,300
located
in Research Triangle Park, 

12
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,634
North Carolina.

13
00:00:27,634 --> 00:00:29,067
And I'm gonna be telling you
a little bit about

14
00:00:29,067 --> 00:00:30,901
what we're doing
with virtual globes

15
00:00:30,901 --> 00:00:33,767
and real-time
air quality data.

16
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:35,667
So first of all,
a little bit of background

17
00:00:35,667 --> 00:00:37,434
about air quality.

18
00:00:37,434 --> 00:00:39,601
Obviously air pollution
affects everyone.

19
00:00:39,601 --> 00:00:41,701
Unlike some
of the other environments

20
00:00:41,701 --> 00:00:43,501
that EPA is concerned with,

21
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:46,100
everybody has
to breathe the air.

22
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,200
Poor air quality
can aggravate lung disease--

23
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,467
including asthma--

24
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:51,934
heart disease--including
congestive heart failure.

25
00:00:51,934 --> 00:00:53,334
And those kind of effects

26
00:00:53,334 --> 00:00:55,701
result in
more premature deaths,

27
00:00:55,701 --> 00:00:57,701
more admissions
to hospitals,

28
00:00:57,701 --> 00:00:59,734
more trips
to the emergency room,

29
00:00:59,734 --> 00:01:01,901
more visits
to doctors' offices,

30
00:01:01,901 --> 00:01:04,067
more school and work absences

31
00:01:04,067 --> 00:01:06,000
for folks that are affected
by those symptoms,

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,300
and more days with symptoms.

33
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,934
So basically,
very quickly what EPA does

34
00:01:12,934 --> 00:01:14,934
in the realm
of air quality data.

35
00:01:14,934 --> 00:01:16,868
The Clean Air Act
actually requires

36
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,767
monitoring and reporting
of air quality data.

37
00:01:19,767 --> 00:01:21,667
A bevy of state
and local agencies

38
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:23,667
collect that data
and report it to EPA.

39
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:26,200
There's not an actual
regulatory requirement

40
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,834
for real-time reporting,

41
00:01:27,834 --> 00:01:29,400
which will come into play
when I talk

42
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,300
about the AIRNow program.

43
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,300
EPA manages
the Air Quality System, AQS,

44
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,334
which is actually
the largest database

45
00:01:36,334 --> 00:01:38,267
of air quality measurements
in the world.

46
00:01:38,267 --> 00:01:41,234
It goes back to as early
as the 1950s.

47
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:43,634
That AQS data,
as I mentioned, is supplied

48
00:01:43,634 --> 00:01:46,267
by the state, local, tribal,
and federal agencies.

49
00:01:46,267 --> 00:01:48,400
And it's used
to determine compliance

50
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,667
with the National
Ambient Air Quality Standards.

51
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:52,267
So if you've ever
heard the phrase is,

52
00:01:52,267 --> 00:01:53,834
"non-attainment area,"

53
00:01:53,834 --> 00:01:57,033
that's what we're judging
based on this AQS data.

54
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:59,234
The reason I point that out

55
00:01:59,234 --> 00:02:01,033
is because
the AIRNow program

56
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:04,267
actually provides real-time
air quality data

57
00:02:04,267 --> 00:02:06,067
and forecasts
for the public.

58
00:02:06,067 --> 00:02:08,033
So about ten years ago,

59
00:02:08,033 --> 00:02:10,334
EPA found that
our region one office

60
00:02:10,334 --> 00:02:11,767
in the northeast

61
00:02:11,767 --> 00:02:14,033
was gathering up
real-time air quality data

62
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:15,634
three times each day

63
00:02:15,634 --> 00:02:17,467
and creating maps
for the public.

64
00:02:17,467 --> 00:02:19,634
So in 1997
we got some funding

65
00:02:19,634 --> 00:02:22,067
to try to expand
that effort nationwide.

66
00:02:22,067 --> 00:02:24,934
I bring this up in contrast
to the Air Quality System,

67
00:02:24,934 --> 00:02:27,534
which we use for our
regulatory purposes.

68
00:02:27,534 --> 00:02:30,033
This is actually reported
in real time,

69
00:02:30,033 --> 00:02:33,200
which again is not required
by regulation.

70
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,033
And we have mostly a focus
upon the public.

71
00:02:37,033 --> 00:02:40,033
This also leverages
existing monitoring activates.

72
00:02:40,033 --> 00:02:42,367
The state and locals
are getting EPA grants

73
00:02:42,367 --> 00:02:43,901
to do this monitoring.

74
00:02:43,901 --> 00:02:46,000
And we're just building
upon that monitoring network

75
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,467
that already exists.

76
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,968
We have a very diverse
stakeholder community.

77
00:02:49,968 --> 00:02:52,501
We have federal, state,
provincial, tribal,

78
00:02:52,501 --> 00:02:53,968
and local air agencies.

79
00:02:53,968 --> 00:02:56,167
And there are over
120 of those agencies

80
00:02:56,167 --> 00:02:58,200
that are submitting
their data voluntarily

81
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,701
to the AIRNow program.

82
00:02:59,701 --> 00:03:02,734
We also have scientific and
health research organizations

83
00:03:02,734 --> 00:03:04,834
that are actually using
that real-time data

84
00:03:04,834 --> 00:03:07,801
to study health effects
on humans.

85
00:03:07,801 --> 00:03:10,634
We also have a lot of media
and public outreach groups.

86
00:03:10,634 --> 00:03:13,033
Our data actually goes
to CNN, "USA Today,"

87
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:14,234
The Weather Channel,

88
00:03:14,234 --> 00:03:16,234
media outlets like that.

89
00:03:16,234 --> 00:03:18,167
We do a lot of education
and outreach

90
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:20,067
through the AIRNow program.

91
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:22,634
Ozone in particular
was difficult to visualize

92
00:03:22,634 --> 00:03:24,667
since it's an odorless,
colorless gas,

93
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:26,400
and we actually
gave the public a tool

94
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,801
that they could kind of see

95
00:03:27,801 --> 00:03:29,701
how ozone formed
in the atmosphere

96
00:03:29,701 --> 00:03:31,734
and watch it move about.

97
00:03:31,734 --> 00:03:34,334
We also have international
interests and activities.

98
00:03:34,334 --> 00:03:37,734
We're actually piloting
a version of the AIRNow system

99
00:03:37,734 --> 00:03:39,434
in Shanghai, China
right now.

100
00:03:39,434 --> 00:03:41,968
The Chinese saw the success
the U.S. had with AIRNow,

101
00:03:41,968 --> 00:03:43,901
and they wanted
to duplicate the system.

102
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:46,534
So we're actually designing
an entirely new system

103
00:03:46,534 --> 00:03:50,133
that we'll use in Shanghai
and in the U.S. next year.

104
00:03:50,133 --> 00:03:52,133
This bottom flow diagram

105
00:03:52,133 --> 00:03:55,300
is a very brief description

106
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,367
of how the AIRNow system
actually works.

107
00:03:57,367 --> 00:04:00,467
We have those 120 plus
state and local air agencies.

108
00:04:00,467 --> 00:04:02,033
They submit their data

109
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,767
to the AIRNow
data management center,

110
00:04:03,767 --> 00:04:05,467
which is actually
not far from here,

111
00:04:05,467 --> 00:04:07,100
up in Petaluma, California.

112
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:11,501
They submit observations
every hour 24 by 7.

113
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,934
And they also
submit forecasts

114
00:04:13,934 --> 00:04:15,601
to this
data management center.

115
00:04:15,601 --> 00:04:17,200
We take that
and then turn around

116
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,701
and create
a national data set

117
00:04:18,701 --> 00:04:21,234
and a national set
of maps and forecasts.

118
00:04:21,234 --> 00:04:23,234
We then perform the function

119
00:04:23,234 --> 00:04:26,133
of distributing that data
and forecast to the media

120
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:30,567
and also to the public
via our airnow.gov website.

121
00:04:30,567 --> 00:04:32,200
And we hope
that that information

122
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,133
gets into the hands
of decision makers in the public

123
00:04:34,133 --> 00:04:35,801
so that they can
avoid exposure

124
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:38,167
to unhealthy levels
of air quality.

125
00:04:38,167 --> 00:04:40,267
On the right-hand side,
you'll see in 1997

126
00:04:40,267 --> 00:04:43,200
this represents
that first regional effort.

127
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,534
EPA took that over
and the 2007 view shows

128
00:04:46,534 --> 00:04:48,767
that we've expanded it
to all 50 states

129
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:51,167
and even the provinces
of Canada.

130
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:52,834
The bottom graphic shows

131
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,400
a special purpose map
that we drew

132
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,234
for the Alaska fires
a couple years ago.

133
00:04:57,234 --> 00:05:00,067
Anytime there's
an emergency or a special event,

134
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:03,167
we'll contribute by creating
real-time data products

135
00:05:03,167 --> 00:05:06,367
for that particular event.

136
00:05:06,367 --> 00:05:08,434
Just a little bit more
about AIRNow.

137
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:09,934
As you've probably
figured out by now,

138
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,267
we do a lot of coordination

139
00:05:11,267 --> 00:05:13,334
between the state and local
agencies and the media.

140
00:05:13,334 --> 00:05:16,000
We provide centralization
for all this air quality data

141
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,701
that's collected at various
levels across the country.

142
00:05:18,701 --> 00:05:20,434
We convert
all the raw data

143
00:05:20,434 --> 00:05:21,934
to the Air Quality Index,

144
00:05:21,934 --> 00:05:24,501
which is our public tool
for recording air quality.

145
00:05:24,501 --> 00:05:26,601
It's a five-color system

146
00:05:26,601 --> 00:05:29,200
that also contains
health effects information

147
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,734
so that the public
can actually figure out

148
00:05:31,734 --> 00:05:34,100
what the air quality is
and what they can do about it.

149
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,033
And we do a lot of education

150
00:05:36,033 --> 00:05:37,801
and lots of distribution.

151
00:05:37,801 --> 00:05:40,367
Over on the right-hand side
you see some of the many ways

152
00:05:40,367 --> 00:05:42,701
we distribute
this air quality data.

153
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:44,000
That first one there

154
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,501
is actually what I'm gonna
show in a minute,

155
00:05:45,501 --> 00:05:47,267
which is one of our
KML products.

156
00:05:47,267 --> 00:05:49,567
And then we have
contour maps of ozone,

157
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:51,067
which you see right beside

158
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:52,968
the Google Earth window there.

159
00:05:52,968 --> 00:05:55,067
We also get our data
onto CNN.

160
00:05:55,067 --> 00:05:57,200
We have a system
that allows you to subscribe

161
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,968
to get real-time
air quality alerts

162
00:05:58,968 --> 00:06:01,167
on your cell phone
or pager.

163
00:06:01,167 --> 00:06:03,801
And we also get coverage
on The Weather Channel,

164
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:08,367
"USA Today" and various other
media outlets.

165
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:10,367
A little bit more
about some of the products

166
00:06:10,367 --> 00:06:11,834
we do in the AIRNow system.

167
00:06:11,834 --> 00:06:14,167
As I mentioned,
we have real-time hourly data.

168
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:17,267
We have forecasts coming in
for over 300 cities.

169
00:06:17,267 --> 00:06:20,300
We produce a national outlook,
which is kind of like

170
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,934
the weather map you
see on TV at night

171
00:06:21,934 --> 00:06:24,334
that predicts
where air quality problems

172
00:06:24,334 --> 00:06:26,434
will occur
in the next day or two.

173
00:06:26,434 --> 00:06:27,934
We do news stories

174
00:06:27,934 --> 00:06:31,367
for, um, particular
wide regional events

175
00:06:31,367 --> 00:06:34,000
or in special cases
like wildfires.

176
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,167
We have webcams
so that people can visually

177
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:38,667
get an idea of what
the air quality looks like.

178
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:40,601
And we do yearly
air comparisons

179
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:43,033
to show how this year
compares to last year

180
00:06:43,033 --> 00:06:46,701
or the last five years.

181
00:06:46,701 --> 00:06:49,067
So what we're doing
with KML--

182
00:06:49,067 --> 00:06:52,300
We actually have
a dynamically-created KML file

183
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,267
or several files
that we create.

184
00:06:54,267 --> 00:06:56,467
We've got the most current
Air Quality Index,

185
00:06:56,467 --> 00:06:59,300
and we update that every hour
as the new data comes in.

186
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,601
We have today's and tomorrow's
forecast Air Quality Index.

187
00:07:02,601 --> 00:07:05,067
And those are all updated
on an hourly basis

188
00:07:05,067 --> 00:07:07,501
based on the latest data
that comes in.

189
00:07:07,501 --> 00:07:09,200
The KMLs also
give more information

190
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,634
via pop-up boxes.

191
00:07:10,634 --> 00:07:13,100
They give you the ozone
and particulate matter

192
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,534
AQI concentrations
for a location

193
00:07:15,534 --> 00:07:17,100
and give you links
to more information

194
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,534
in case you have
other questions.

195
00:07:20,534 --> 00:07:22,667
Outside of my program,

196
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:25,033
EPA is also doing some other
air quality applications.

197
00:07:25,033 --> 00:07:28,434
We have a KML file
for emissions data.

198
00:07:28,434 --> 00:07:30,000
It has a really neat feature

199
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,968
where basically
the height of the balloon

200
00:07:31,968 --> 00:07:33,901
shows the total emissions
for a facility,

201
00:07:33,901 --> 00:07:35,968
and I'll show that
in just a moment.

202
00:07:35,968 --> 00:07:37,501
We also allow people to see

203
00:07:37,501 --> 00:07:39,701
where the actual air quality
monitors are located

204
00:07:39,701 --> 00:07:41,133
via a KML.

205
00:07:41,133 --> 00:07:42,667
And that's
a very neat function

206
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:45,033
because in the past
people might find

207
00:07:45,033 --> 00:07:46,234
the address of a monitor,

208
00:07:46,234 --> 00:07:47,901
they might be able
to plot it on a map,

209
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:50,133
but with Google Earth
you can now actually see

210
00:07:50,133 --> 00:07:51,701
what's around that monitor
and detect

211
00:07:51,701 --> 00:07:53,534
if there are schools
or parking lots

212
00:07:53,534 --> 00:07:55,267
or if its near
a busy intersection,

213
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:57,734
things like that.

214
00:07:57,734 --> 00:07:59,968
So we've come to the part
where I'm gonna try

215
00:07:59,968 --> 00:08:01,367
to do some
live demonstrations,

216
00:08:01,367 --> 00:08:04,601
which is kind of
the technology equivalent

217
00:08:04,601 --> 00:08:07,434
of a bungee jump,
but we'll hope it works.

218
00:08:07,434 --> 00:08:10,367
First the location
of air quality monitors.

219
00:08:10,367 --> 00:08:12,200
This takes you to
an EPA web page.

220
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,400
And we monitor for a variety
of different pollutants,

221
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,434
so you can pull up
these different layers

222
00:08:17,434 --> 00:08:19,133
depending on the pollutant
you're interested in.

223
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:21,834
I'm gonna click
on the ozone layer.

224
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,734
Oh, that was
an interesting choice,

225
00:08:23,734 --> 00:08:24,968
the ozone layer.

226
00:08:24,968 --> 00:08:26,567
This is actually
ground-based ozone,

227
00:08:26,567 --> 00:08:28,167
so don't get that confused.

228
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:29,767
So what we're doing here
is we're pulling up

229
00:08:29,767 --> 00:08:31,501
a live KML file

230
00:08:31,501 --> 00:08:36,167
of the actual
ozone monitoring locations.

231
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:40,000
And you can zoom in on this.

232
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,968
Having a little trouble
with my mouse.

233
00:08:41,968 --> 00:08:43,467
Here we go.

234
00:08:43,467 --> 00:08:47,767
You zoom in here.

235
00:08:47,767 --> 00:08:50,067
Whoops.
Okay.

236
00:08:50,067 --> 00:08:52,234
You can actually see
the monitoring locations.

237
00:08:52,234 --> 00:08:54,734
And if you click on one,

238
00:08:54,734 --> 00:09:00,167
you can get more information
about that particular monitor.

239
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:02,801
So you'll see here this
particular monitor I chose

240
00:09:02,801 --> 00:09:05,968
is in Salt Lake--
near Salt Lake City in Utah.

241
00:09:05,968 --> 00:09:07,901
You can get a lot
of different information

242
00:09:07,901 --> 00:09:09,801
about the monitor itself

243
00:09:09,801 --> 00:09:11,801
that comes out
of our air quality system.

244
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,467
And you can even download
some of the historical data

245
00:09:13,467 --> 00:09:15,834
for that particular site.

246
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,434
Um, obviously,
you can zoom in closer

247
00:09:22,434 --> 00:09:24,501
and see what kind of terrain
the monitor has around it

248
00:09:24,501 --> 00:09:29,601
and get a lot of different
visual information.

249
00:09:29,601 --> 00:09:34,033
So I'm gonna jump back out.

250
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:37,000
Whoops.

251
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,234
Didn't mean to do that.

252
00:09:38,234 --> 00:09:40,934
Okay.

253
00:09:40,934 --> 00:09:43,868
This next one is actually
a KML file

254
00:09:43,868 --> 00:09:46,467
that references
three other KML files

255
00:09:46,467 --> 00:09:49,834
which give you information
on current air quality

256
00:09:49,834 --> 00:09:52,100
and forecast.

257
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,067
So again we're loading
Google Earth here.

258
00:10:04,067 --> 00:10:07,000
We're grabbing three files
that are generated every hour

259
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,801
by the AIRNow system.

260
00:10:08,801 --> 00:10:10,801
One has the latest conditions

261
00:10:10,801 --> 00:10:13,100
at every major
metropolitan area.

262
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,701
The other has
a forecast for today

263
00:10:15,701 --> 00:10:17,968
and a forecast
for tomorrow.

264
00:10:23,067 --> 00:10:25,667
And I'm just gonna
zoom in on one here.

265
00:10:29,334 --> 00:10:32,834
You'll see there's one
in the Denver area.

266
00:10:32,834 --> 00:10:34,067
When you mouse over it,

267
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:35,701
you see
the current AQI is 94,

268
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:38,200
which is a yellow AQI.

269
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,868
If you click on it,
you get a pop-up box.

270
00:10:40,868 --> 00:10:44,100
And you'll see here
immediately the PM, 2.5,

271
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,501
AQI is 94,

272
00:10:45,501 --> 00:10:47,501
the ozone AQI is 32.

273
00:10:47,501 --> 00:10:49,300
EPA regulations require

274
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,400
that the cities report
whichever is highest.

275
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,901
So that's where
the 94 is coming from.

276
00:10:54,901 --> 00:10:56,400
Okay, and then over
on the side

277
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,934
you'll see
the radio buttons.

278
00:10:57,934 --> 00:10:59,834
You can switch
to today's forecast.

279
00:10:59,834 --> 00:11:02,300
There's another view,

280
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,501
and it will take it
a minute to load.

281
00:11:05,501 --> 00:11:08,367
You can see the forecast
for Denver for today

282
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:10,434
is that it will reach a 50.

283
00:11:10,434 --> 00:11:12,067
And if you click
on that again,

284
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:15,200
you'll see that
the, um, 50--

285
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,634
It looks like ozone and PM
are gonna be 50.

286
00:11:17,634 --> 00:11:19,133
Interesting.

287
00:11:19,133 --> 00:11:21,200
So that's
the forecast for today.

288
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,100
Similarly, if you click
on the next radio button,

289
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,400
you can get
tomorrow's forecast.

290
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,767
And you'll see it's 50
for tomorrow as well.

291
00:11:34,767 --> 00:11:37,300
One thing
I forgot to point out.

292
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,067
Just so you know
there's no tricks up my sleeve.

293
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,701
If you'll notice here,

294
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:47,167
this data was at
3:00 Mountain Standard Time.

295
00:11:47,167 --> 00:11:53,133
So it is almost
real time there.

296
00:11:53,133 --> 00:11:56,968
And lastly,
another group in my office

297
00:11:56,968 --> 00:11:59,367
does national emissions
inventory,

298
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:01,834
which is a collection of all
the facility emissions data.

299
00:12:01,834 --> 00:12:07,734
They've also done a KML file
with that data.

300
00:12:07,734 --> 00:12:12,801
And on this one,

301
00:12:12,801 --> 00:12:14,868
when you bring this up
it'll show you the locations

302
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:17,200
of actual plants
across the country.

303
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,234
That's why there's so many
of those little balloons.

304
00:12:21,234 --> 00:12:24,133
And if you zoom into one...

305
00:12:28,601 --> 00:12:31,968
you'll see the balloon
gives you more information

306
00:12:31,968 --> 00:12:33,601
on that facility.

307
00:12:33,601 --> 00:12:35,667
It also gives you a graph
of the different emissions

308
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:37,400
coming out
of that facility

309
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,067
and their relative
contribution to the total.

310
00:12:41,067 --> 00:12:45,667
And my favorite feature
of this particular map

311
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:50,467
is if you rotate
the map like so

312
00:12:50,467 --> 00:12:53,267
the height of the balloon
actually is the total emissions

313
00:12:53,267 --> 00:12:55,267
of those sources.

314
00:12:55,267 --> 00:12:57,234
So when you look
across the landscape,

315
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,334
you can see the highest balloons
are the facilities

316
00:12:59,334 --> 00:13:01,767
that are emitting
the highest amount

317
00:13:01,767 --> 00:13:03,200
for that particular area.

318
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,534
So if you click
on one of those,

319
00:13:06,534 --> 00:13:08,634
you'll see its emissions
are fairly high

320
00:13:08,634 --> 00:13:14,167
compared to some
of its neighbors.

321
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:18,601
Okay.

322
00:13:18,601 --> 00:13:20,667
And that is about all I have.

323
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:22,534
I'll encourage you
to "invisit" our--

324
00:13:22,534 --> 00:13:24,934
to visit our website,
airnow.gov,

325
00:13:24,934 --> 00:13:26,801
where you can find
a lot more information

326
00:13:26,801 --> 00:13:28,133
on air quality,

327
00:13:28,133 --> 00:13:30,067
including information
about the Air Quality Index.

328
00:13:30,067 --> 00:13:33,667
You can get data, forecasts,
news items, publications,

329
00:13:33,667 --> 00:13:35,334
and a lot more.

330
00:13:35,334 --> 00:13:39,667
And at this point
I'll take questions.

331
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:43,634
Yes?

332
00:13:43,634 --> 00:13:46,367
Ah.

333
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,000
Yes, the question was,

334
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,601
"How do we do forecasts
and how good are they?"

335
00:13:50,601 --> 00:13:52,267
The forecasts
are actually done, again,

336
00:13:52,267 --> 00:13:53,901
by the state
and local agencies.

337
00:13:53,901 --> 00:13:55,601
And they use a variety
of different methods.

338
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,334
Some of them are statistical.

339
00:13:57,334 --> 00:13:59,200
Some of them
are numeric models.

340
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,767
And every now and then,

341
00:14:00,767 --> 00:14:02,634
they actually use
some human intuition,

342
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:04,767
which you could also
call a guess.

343
00:14:04,767 --> 00:14:06,901
And, um,
so the different methods

344
00:14:06,901 --> 00:14:09,934
have different degrees
of accuracy.

345
00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:12,033
And it also depends a lot
on the weather.

346
00:14:12,033 --> 00:14:14,100
'Cause air quality
is very much affected

347
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,501
by the meteorology.

348
00:14:15,501 --> 00:14:18,267
So as far as accuracy,
kind of a rule of thumb

349
00:14:18,267 --> 00:14:22,133
is it's somewhere in the range
of 70% to 75% on average.

350
00:14:22,133 --> 00:14:24,300
But it varies a lot
depending on the area

351
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,968
and the technique.

352
00:14:25,968 --> 00:14:27,434
Another thing I should add

353
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:29,067
is our friends at NOAH

354
00:14:29,067 --> 00:14:30,934
have a national
air quality forecast model

355
00:14:30,934 --> 00:14:32,334
for ozone right now.

356
00:14:32,334 --> 00:14:33,968
So if you go
to NOAH's website,

357
00:14:33,968 --> 00:14:35,901
you can actually see
their numerical model

358
00:14:35,901 --> 00:14:38,067
of the entire country
for ozone.

359
00:14:38,067 --> 00:14:40,367
And they're doing
an experimental domain

360
00:14:40,367 --> 00:14:42,067
for particulate matter.

361
00:14:42,067 --> 00:14:43,901
There's a lot of different
products out there

362
00:14:43,901 --> 00:14:48,133
that figure into
the forecast.

363
00:14:48,133 --> 00:14:51,767
Okay, any other questions?

364
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:53,033
Thank you.

365
00:14:53,033 --> 00:14:54,968
