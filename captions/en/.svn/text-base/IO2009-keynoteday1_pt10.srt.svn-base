1
00:00:01,267 --> 00:00:03,400
Gundrota: First I'd like
to announce that we are--

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,367
have part two of
the Android Developer Challenge

3
00:00:06,367 --> 00:00:07,601
being announced today.

4
00:00:07,601 --> 00:00:09,901
The details are located
at that url.

5
00:00:09,901 --> 00:00:12,834
We will take submissions
for the contest in August,

6
00:00:12,834 --> 00:00:14,567
judging will occur
through the fall,

7
00:00:14,567 --> 00:00:16,968
and we'll announce our winners
at the end of fall.

8
00:00:16,968 --> 00:00:19,601
This time we've learned a few
things from <i>American Idol,</i>

9
00:00:19,601 --> 00:00:22,400
and so we will have user votes
as part of the judging,

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,701
and we think this contest

11
00:00:23,701 --> 00:00:25,601
is going to be really,
really exciting.

12
00:00:25,601 --> 00:00:27,901
Number two,
I'd like to announce

13
00:00:27,901 --> 00:00:29,968
that we're going to give away--

14
00:00:29,968 --> 00:00:32,934
to every conference
attendee today,

15
00:00:32,934 --> 00:00:34,868
all 4,000 of you, this box,

16
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:38,901
which contains a link
to the SDK documentation...

17
00:00:41,167 --> 00:00:44,267
[laughter]

18
00:00:44,267 --> 00:00:47,234
And a few more surprises...

19
00:00:47,234 --> 00:00:50,434
including an Android phone.

20
00:00:50,434 --> 00:00:53,367
[cheers and applause]

21
00:01:00,033 --> 00:01:03,467
This...

22
00:01:03,467 --> 00:01:05,767
I think,
you know, we realized

23
00:01:05,767 --> 00:01:07,868
that you could
go download the SDK,

24
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:10,601
you could use the emulator,

25
00:01:10,601 --> 00:01:13,400
but nothing beats
having a real device.

26
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,200
And I've always wanted
an Oprah moment,

27
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,367
so for you, and you, and you.

28
00:01:18,367 --> 00:01:20,400
[applause]

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,300
There's one more thing.

30
00:01:26,734 --> 00:01:29,133
This is an unlocked device
that'll be available.

31
00:01:29,133 --> 00:01:31,534
In addition,
we went one step further.

32
00:01:31,534 --> 00:01:33,300
Included in every device

33
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,634
will be a SIM that gives you
unlimited 3G data

34
00:01:37,634 --> 00:01:42,834
and thousands of hours
of calls for 30 days.

35
00:01:42,834 --> 00:01:44,934
And so we realized
some of you don't have a SIM

36
00:01:44,934 --> 00:01:47,434
to get started tonight,
you might have a CDMA phone,

37
00:01:47,434 --> 00:01:48,734
but we think this is a nice way

38
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:51,100
to get started on you
exploring the platform.

39
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,033
[cheers and applause]

40
00:01:59,968 --> 00:02:01,934
It's our
small way of saying

41
00:02:01,934 --> 00:02:04,434
thank you for supporting
our conference as well.

42
00:02:04,434 --> 00:02:06,801
I'd like to conclude
by just making

43
00:02:06,801 --> 00:02:08,734
a few more quick announcements.

44
00:02:08,734 --> 00:02:10,968
If you thought
that surprise was fun,

45
00:02:10,968 --> 00:02:12,901
we have another
surprise for you.

46
00:02:12,901 --> 00:02:15,100
Please don't miss
tomorrow's keynote.

47
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:19,133
Tomorrow's keynote, I think,
will surprise many of you

48
00:02:19,133 --> 00:02:22,567
with some exciting things
that have not yet leaked,

49
00:02:22,567 --> 00:02:24,067
and we're so excited about that.

50
00:02:24,067 --> 00:02:25,467
[laughter]

51
00:02:25,467 --> 00:02:27,234
So you'll enjoy that.

52
00:02:27,234 --> 00:02:29,767
Number two,
picking up your device--

53
00:02:29,767 --> 00:02:32,934
you can pick up your device
starting this afternoon

54
00:02:32,934 --> 00:02:34,300
throughout
the entire conference.

55
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,701
So you don't have to go rush.

56
00:02:35,701 --> 00:02:37,934
You don't have to go
queue up in line right now.

57
00:02:37,934 --> 00:02:39,968
Go to your sessions,
and in the afternoon

58
00:02:39,968 --> 00:02:41,267
at the registration area,

59
00:02:41,267 --> 00:02:44,634
we'll start giving out
all 4,000-plus devices.

60
00:02:44,634 --> 00:02:47,133
And we'll continue that
through the party tonight.

61
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:48,968
So don't miss
the after hours party.

62
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:50,467
We're going to have
some great DJs.

63
00:02:50,467 --> 00:02:52,634
Like last year, we're
going to have a lot of fun.

64
00:02:52,634 --> 00:02:54,234
And, of course, many Googlers

65
00:02:54,234 --> 00:02:55,734
will be there
to interact with you.

66
00:02:55,734 --> 00:02:57,667
So once again, thank you
for attending the keynote,

67
00:02:57,667 --> 00:02:58,934
enjoy the conference,

68
00:02:58,934 --> 00:03:01,167
and thank you
for supporting Google I/O.

69
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:04,834
[cheers and applause]

70
00:03:04,834 --> 00:03:09,267
recorded male voice:
Welcome to Google I/O.
