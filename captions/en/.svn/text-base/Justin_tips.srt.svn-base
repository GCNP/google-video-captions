00:00:00,901 --> 00:00:02,234
Kitagawa: One tip I have
is to use

2
00:00:02,234 --> 00:00:04,667
and look
into the event preview.

3
00:00:04,667 --> 00:00:07,701
So by registering
a event preview,

4
00:00:07,701 --> 00:00:10,334
you're able to register
a global listener

5
00:00:10,334 --> 00:00:12,934
for all events that
are occurring in the browser.

6
00:00:12,934 --> 00:00:15,767
This, um--events such as
mouse movements,

7
00:00:15,767 --> 00:00:19,167
um, various mouse clicks,
left/right mouse button,

8
00:00:19,167 --> 00:00:22,133
um, and scroll wheel events.

9
00:00:22,133 --> 00:00:26,167
Regardless of which widget
is in focus,

10
00:00:26,167 --> 00:00:28,734
you're able to see
and register those events,

11
00:00:28,734 --> 00:00:30,434
and then be able
to take action on it.

12
00:00:30,434 --> 00:00:31,934
So this is a way
that you could implement,

13
00:00:31,934 --> 00:00:34,467
like, a global key listener
or something like that.

14
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:36,667
So if you wanted to have
an application--

15
00:00:36,667 --> 00:00:40,634
that control-S or something
does something--saves--

16
00:00:40,634 --> 00:00:42,634
you're able
to do it using that.
