One tip when writing
a GWT app

2
00:00:01,767 --> 00:00:04,000
is to remember that security

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,634
needs to happen
on the server

4
00:00:05,634 --> 00:00:07,200
and not just
on the client.

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,667
If you have
different permissions

6
00:00:08,667 --> 00:00:10,133
based on user roles,

7
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:11,934
you need to make sure
that those are incorporated

8
00:00:11,934 --> 00:00:13,701
into server-side requests

9
00:00:13,701 --> 00:00:16,100
and that you don't send
the wrong data to the client,

10
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,567
which could then accidentally
be exposed.
