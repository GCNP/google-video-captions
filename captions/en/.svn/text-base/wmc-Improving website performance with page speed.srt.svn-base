Kerner: Hi, my name
is Sam Kerner,

2
00:00:06,834 --> 00:00:08,267
and I'm a software engineer
at Google

3
00:00:08,267 --> 00:00:10,133
working on making Google faster.

4
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:12,367
Page Speed is a tool that gives
you concrete suggestions

5
00:00:12,367 --> 00:00:14,167
for how to make
your web site faster.

6
00:00:14,167 --> 00:00:16,133
We look for things like,
did you compress your images,

7
00:00:16,133 --> 00:00:18,434
did you set
proper caching headers,

8
00:00:18,434 --> 00:00:20,434
did you write efficient
JavaScript, and so on.

9
00:00:20,434 --> 00:00:22,534
In order to show you
what Page Speed can do,

10
00:00:22,534 --> 00:00:24,501
I have created
a very simple website,

11
00:00:24,501 --> 00:00:27,334
and I am going
to apply Page Speed to it

12
00:00:27,334 --> 00:00:29,000
and show you the suggestions.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,167
There are three images
on this page,

14
00:00:32,167 --> 00:00:35,634
some JavaScript to create
the effect

15
00:00:35,634 --> 00:00:39,167
of pointing at an image
and showing some text,

16
00:00:39,167 --> 00:00:41,968
and I'm going to start
Page Speed,

17
00:00:41,968 --> 00:00:45,667
which is a Firebug extension,
so I click on the Firebug icon,

18
00:00:45,667 --> 00:00:47,834
click on the Page Speed tab,

19
00:00:47,834 --> 00:00:49,734
and click "Analyze Performance."

20
00:00:49,734 --> 00:00:53,033
And then I get a list
of suggestions.

21
00:00:53,033 --> 00:00:55,167
The first suggestion
that I'm going to look at

22
00:00:55,167 --> 00:00:57,033
is "Minify JavaScript."

23
00:00:57,033 --> 00:00:59,367
This rule tells me that
there are 12 kilobytes' worth

24
00:00:59,367 --> 00:01:03,801
of JavaScript,
and 98.3% of them are redundant.

25
00:01:03,801 --> 00:01:05,667
So here's the JavaScript I have,

26
00:01:05,667 --> 00:01:08,367
and you can see I added
a very long comment.

27
00:01:08,367 --> 00:01:12,267
And Page Speed produces
the minified version,

28
00:01:12,267 --> 00:01:14,968
the version without comments
or white space.

29
00:01:14,968 --> 00:01:18,400
So I'm going to use that
instead.

30
00:01:24,934 --> 00:01:26,734
And now I reload the page...

31
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,334
analyze performance...

32
00:01:31,334 --> 00:01:33,167
and you can see
that I don't get a warning

33
00:01:33,167 --> 00:01:35,334
about excess JavaScript.

34
00:01:35,334 --> 00:01:39,167
The next rule I'm gonna look at
is "Optimizing images."

35
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:42,100
The rule is telling me that
the three images on the page

36
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,133
are not well compressed.

37
00:01:44,133 --> 00:01:46,100
And it even gives me
the compressed version.

38
00:01:48,434 --> 00:01:51,367
So if I save it

39
00:01:51,367 --> 00:01:54,300
and do the same
for the two other images...

40
00:02:01,367 --> 00:02:02,834
reload the page,

41
00:02:02,834 --> 00:02:04,767
analyze performance again,

42
00:02:04,767 --> 00:02:08,767
and I no longer get a warning
about compressing images.

43
00:02:08,767 --> 00:02:10,667
The rules I've just shown you
are a small set

44
00:02:10,667 --> 00:02:13,534
of what Page Speed can help
you improve on your website.

45
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:15,834
