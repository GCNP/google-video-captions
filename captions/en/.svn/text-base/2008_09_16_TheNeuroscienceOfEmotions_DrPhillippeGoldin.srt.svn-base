1
01:00:02,801 --> 01:00:05,234
Ming: Hello.
Uh, good afternoon, my friends.

2
01:00:05,234 --> 01:00:07,534
Uh, my name is Ming,
and I'm the owner

3
01:00:07,534 --> 01:00:10,033
of the Search Inside Yourself
Program in Google,

4
01:00:10,033 --> 01:00:12,467
or the S.I.Y. Program.

5
01:00:12,467 --> 01:00:15,934
S.I.Y. is Google's home-grown
emotional intelligence--

6
01:00:15,934 --> 01:00:18,234
Uh, sorry--
home-grown, mindfulness-based

7
01:00:18,234 --> 01:00:20,000
emotional intelligence course,

8
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,901
and we hope someday
to make this course

9
01:00:21,901 --> 01:00:24,234
accessible to the whole world.

10
01:00:24,234 --> 01:00:27,234
This lecture will become
part of the content

11
01:00:27,234 --> 01:00:30,334
for the S.I.Y. course
in the future.

12
01:00:30,334 --> 01:00:33,367
And, uh, I'm delighted today
to introduce my dear friend

13
01:00:33,367 --> 01:00:36,934
and S.I.Y. instructor
Philippe Goldin.

14
01:00:36,934 --> 01:00:40,534
Philippe heads the clinic--
Lemme get this--

15
01:00:40,534 --> 01:00:44,300
clinically applied affective
neuroscience group

16
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:46,334
Uh, in the department
of psychology

17
01:00:46,334 --> 01:00:48,667
at Stanford University.

18
01:00:48,667 --> 01:00:51,868
He spent six years
in India and Nepal

19
01:00:51,868 --> 01:00:53,834
studying various languages.

20
01:00:53,834 --> 01:00:55,801
I don't actually know
how many languages he speaks,

21
01:00:55,801 --> 01:00:57,901
but it's, like, more than three.

22
01:00:57,901 --> 01:01:01,801
And, uh, he studied Buddhist
philosophy and debate

23
01:01:01,801 --> 01:01:03,601
at various monasteries.

24
01:01:03,601 --> 01:01:05,767
And then he returned to the US

25
01:01:05,767 --> 01:01:08,934
to complete a Ph.D.
in clinical psychology

26
01:01:08,934 --> 01:01:11,300
at Rutgers University.

27
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:15,601
His research focuses on function
and neuroimaging investigations

28
01:01:15,601 --> 01:01:18,200
of cognitive,
affective mechanisms.

29
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:19,901
Whew.
[laughter]

30
01:01:19,901 --> 01:01:22,100
The effect
of mindfulness meditation

31
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:24,501
and cognitive behavior therapy,

32
01:01:24,501 --> 01:01:29,501
and the effect of parent-child
mindfulness meditation training.

33
01:01:29,501 --> 01:01:31,934
And, oh, by the way,
he's also a meditation teacher,

34
01:01:31,934 --> 01:01:34,000
in case you missed that.

35
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,467
And in person
I find Philippe to be

36
01:01:36,467 --> 01:01:40,300
very smart, very capable,
and very compassionate.

37
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:42,200
And I'm very happy
he's my friend.

38
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,033
He's just amazing.

39
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:47,334
And, uh, my friends,
please welcome Philippe Goldin.

40
01:01:47,334 --> 01:01:50,868
[applause]

41
01:01:50,868 --> 01:01:54,300
Philippe: Very nice.

42
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:56,834
Okay. So, it's an honor
to be here.

43
01:01:56,834 --> 01:01:58,167
and I know that
everyone is very busy,

44
01:01:58,167 --> 01:02:00,868
so I really appreciate
that you are here.

45
01:02:00,868 --> 01:02:04,167
Um...Let's begin.

46
01:02:04,167 --> 01:02:06,000
So, yes, I'm going to speak

47
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,801
about the neuroscience
of emotions.

48
01:02:08,801 --> 01:02:11,934
And, um, yes, I do come
from an academic background,

49
01:02:11,934 --> 01:02:14,434
and also a practice background.

50
01:02:14,434 --> 01:02:17,467
And just to be really clear,
the intention for today

51
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:19,200
is to give you
a brief introduction

52
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:22,133
to a little bit
about what we understand

53
01:02:22,133 --> 01:02:24,434
about the neuroscience and how
the brain works

54
01:02:24,434 --> 01:02:25,801
with respect to emotions,

55
01:02:25,801 --> 01:02:28,100
emotion regulation,
emotion intelligence.

56
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:30,567
But it'll be brief because
we only have a short time.

57
01:02:30,567 --> 01:02:32,667
And, uh, this obviously--

58
01:02:32,667 --> 01:02:34,534
We should start
with some history.

59
01:02:34,534 --> 01:02:38,200
So, Darwin, um,
speaking about emotions,

60
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:42,934
made it very clear that animals
need emotions to survive.

61
01:02:42,934 --> 01:02:44,868
So do we.

62
01:02:44,868 --> 01:02:47,901
They need fear as a trigger
to escape predators,

63
01:02:47,901 --> 01:02:49,868
and aggression to defend
their territory,

64
01:02:49,868 --> 01:02:52,234
their young, and food.

65
01:02:52,234 --> 01:02:54,200
Emotions--
He believed that emotions

66
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:57,300
are really maintained
from our animal past

67
01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:00,667
in the trajectory
of evolution of human animals.

68
01:03:00,667 --> 01:03:02,234
And that we really rely

69
01:03:02,234 --> 01:03:04,501
on different emotions
in different ways

70
01:03:04,501 --> 01:03:09,067
to make quick,
often complex, decisions.

71
01:03:09,067 --> 01:03:11,634
So why do we have emotions?

72
01:03:11,634 --> 01:03:15,000
Um, as you can see here,
just looking at this photograph,

73
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,067
just notice where
your attention goes.

74
01:03:17,067 --> 01:03:19,300
Notice what you see.

75
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:23,834
So, from multiple
decades of research on emotions,

76
01:03:23,834 --> 01:03:26,467
we know that
there are several functions.

77
01:03:26,467 --> 01:03:30,968
One way--emotions help
to direct our attention.

78
01:03:30,968 --> 01:03:33,701
It helps to enhance our memory
and how we actually

79
01:03:33,701 --> 01:03:37,033
encode and consolidate
different pieces of information.

80
01:03:37,033 --> 01:03:42,033
Especially for information
that's personally salient.

81
01:03:42,033 --> 01:03:44,534
It also helps us
to organize our behavior

82
01:03:44,534 --> 01:03:47,200
and our orientation
towards other people.

83
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,167
Um, specifically how we drive--

84
01:03:49,167 --> 01:03:51,934
It helps to drive
and direct social approach

85
01:03:51,934 --> 01:03:54,901
or even social avoidance.

86
01:03:54,901 --> 01:03:58,067
And, probably most importantly
for this group,

87
01:03:58,067 --> 01:03:59,300
and for the course--

88
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:01,234
the Search Inside
Yourself course,

89
01:04:01,234 --> 01:04:02,801
is that different emotions

90
01:04:02,801 --> 01:04:05,100
and the way our learning
history with emotions

91
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:10,934
really helps to develop
moral and ethical behavior.

92
01:04:10,934 --> 01:04:14,033
When emotions--and the brain
is functioning well,

93
01:04:14,033 --> 01:04:15,734
it can be an incredibly
adaptive system,

94
01:04:15,734 --> 01:04:19,400
meaning that emotions bring
richness to our experience,

95
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:22,734
how we interact with people,
how we interact with ourselves.

96
01:04:22,734 --> 01:04:27,100
When emotions are dysregulated,
out of control, exaggerated,

97
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:30,667
this can lead to things
like anxiety, depression,

98
01:04:30,667 --> 01:04:32,501
burn-out, even suicide.

99
01:04:32,501 --> 01:04:34,567
So this is really
a very important aspect

100
01:04:34,567 --> 01:04:36,834
of the human experience.

101
01:04:36,834 --> 01:04:38,667
There are different
classes of emotion.

102
01:04:38,667 --> 01:04:40,801
So, researchers have talked

103
01:04:40,801 --> 01:04:44,167
about six primary
or basic emotions.

104
01:04:44,167 --> 01:04:45,567
They are happiness--
as you can see--

105
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:51,200
Happiness, surprise, fear,
sadness, disgust, and anger.

106
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:52,634
And you can check
your own experience

107
01:04:52,634 --> 01:04:55,434
as we go through this talk
to see how this aligns

108
01:04:55,434 --> 01:04:57,934
with what you've
experienced in yourself.

109
01:04:57,934 --> 01:04:59,834
There's also
kind of a background

110
01:04:59,834 --> 01:05:01,567
sense of emotion or mood--

111
01:05:01,567 --> 01:05:02,934
Moods are long-term,

112
01:05:02,934 --> 01:05:06,267
emotions are more punctate
or short, acute.

113
01:05:06,267 --> 01:05:10,467
So they talk often
about wellbeing versus malaise.

114
01:05:10,467 --> 01:05:14,634
A sense of calm
versus a sense of tension.

115
01:05:14,634 --> 01:05:17,033
Feelings of pain,
emotional and physical,

116
01:05:17,033 --> 01:05:20,734
in contrast to pleasure.

117
01:05:20,734 --> 01:05:23,701
And then, importantly,
especially for social animals

118
01:05:23,701 --> 01:05:26,734
like human beings, all of us,
there's a whole other realm

119
01:05:26,734 --> 01:05:30,501
of social emotions that are
in contrast to the primary.

120
01:05:30,501 --> 01:05:34,067
And this really has to do
with interpersonal interaction,

121
01:05:34,067 --> 01:05:37,601
so emotions that arise
like embarrassment, jealousy,

122
01:05:37,601 --> 01:05:41,467
guilt, shame, sense of pride.

123
01:05:41,467 --> 01:05:45,467
So this is a rough sketch of
the different kinds of emotions.

124
01:05:45,467 --> 01:05:48,968
Now, emotions
are obviously expressed.

125
01:05:48,968 --> 01:05:51,234
One of the most powerful,
ubiquitous ways

126
01:05:51,234 --> 01:05:53,100
is through our
facial expressions.

127
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:55,467
So these are
the six primary emotions

128
01:05:55,467 --> 01:05:58,701
and the facial expressions
of those emotions.

129
01:05:58,701 --> 01:05:59,968
As you can see.

130
01:05:59,968 --> 01:06:02,133
And apparently,
in the English language,

131
01:06:02,133 --> 01:06:05,734
there are over 600 words
to describe different emotions,

132
01:06:05,734 --> 01:06:09,767
and on your face
there are 42 different muscles

133
01:06:09,767 --> 01:06:12,901
that work together
to express, very subtly,

134
01:06:12,901 --> 01:06:14,434
different emotional expressions.

135
01:06:14,434 --> 01:06:17,734
And Paul Ekman
from U.C. San Francisco,

136
01:06:17,734 --> 01:06:19,434
emeritus professor,

137
01:06:19,434 --> 01:06:22,501
actually came up with
a facial action coding system

138
01:06:22,501 --> 01:06:27,434
to actually delineate
what muscle groups need to arise

139
01:06:27,434 --> 01:06:29,601
in order to make different
emotional expressions.

140
01:06:29,601 --> 01:06:33,501
So there's a whole science
behind all of this.

141
01:06:33,501 --> 01:06:37,400
It's not only an American
or a North American

142
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:39,100
emotional expression thing.

143
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:41,968
In fact, lots of research
by Paul Ekman and other people

144
01:06:41,968 --> 01:06:44,100
have shown
that the identification

145
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:47,000
of different facial expressions
is cross-cultural,

146
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,267
as you can see, and there's
a very high rate of consensus

147
01:06:50,267 --> 01:06:53,000
across different cultures,
different backgrounds,

148
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,334
about what constitutes
happiness, sadness,

149
01:06:55,334 --> 01:06:58,200
disgust, and so forth.

150
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:02,067
Another very important purpose
for studying emotions

151
01:07:02,067 --> 01:07:04,767
is that emotions are truly,
if you think about it,

152
01:07:04,767 --> 01:07:06,434
and check your own experience--

153
01:07:06,434 --> 01:07:10,834
are an important source
of information and feedback

154
01:07:10,834 --> 01:07:13,534
that help to direct our behavior

155
01:07:13,534 --> 01:07:15,300
and also our
social interactions.

156
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:16,634
So you can think,

157
01:07:16,634 --> 01:07:20,167
how often do we use
a gut feeling or a gut instinct

158
01:07:20,167 --> 01:07:23,601
or kind of an intuition
to make a quick decision?

159
01:07:23,601 --> 01:07:25,167
And, in fact, I would suggest

160
01:07:25,167 --> 01:07:26,667
that if you check
your experience,

161
01:07:26,667 --> 01:07:29,300
this is happening
many times per day.

162
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:31,133
So emotions
are really contributing

163
01:07:31,133 --> 01:07:33,234
to cognitive processes.

164
01:07:33,234 --> 01:07:36,300
Thinking, reasoning,
decision making.

165
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:38,067
Now, we know that here,
in the brain,

166
01:07:38,067 --> 01:07:41,434
when a person has a lesion,
right, the absence of a--

167
01:07:41,434 --> 01:07:43,501
be it a tumor
or some kind of disease,

168
01:07:43,501 --> 01:07:46,167
we know that
frontal lobe lesions

169
01:07:46,167 --> 01:07:49,634
often result in impaired
emotional awareness.

170
01:07:49,634 --> 01:07:52,601
Which goes along with
impairment in social reasoning

171
01:07:52,601 --> 01:07:54,534
or interpersonal problems,

172
01:07:54,534 --> 01:07:56,868
and also problems
making decisions.

173
01:07:56,868 --> 01:07:58,534
So we know that there's
a direct connection

174
01:07:58,534 --> 01:08:01,400
between the functions
of brain systems

175
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:05,767
and different aspects
of emotion and their sequelli.

176
01:08:05,767 --> 01:08:08,868
Emotions really exist
on a range.

177
01:08:08,868 --> 01:08:10,033
I'm stating the obvious.

178
01:08:10,033 --> 01:08:11,667
From a normal sense of emotions,

179
01:08:11,667 --> 01:08:14,400
and then the extreme
forms of those emotions.

180
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,400
So I would posit that sadness,

181
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:18,634
which is a very normal
human experience,

182
01:08:18,634 --> 01:08:21,901
in its extreme,
can lead to major depression.

183
01:08:21,901 --> 01:08:24,834
Can be a very important
component of major depression.

184
01:08:24,834 --> 01:08:29,901
Anger, which also is
a very normal human emotion,

185
01:08:29,901 --> 01:08:32,367
when it reaches an extreme
or an exaggerated form,

186
01:08:32,367 --> 01:08:33,901
can become
unprovoked aggression.

187
01:08:33,901 --> 01:08:38,000
An angry orientation in all
of our social interactions.

188
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,067
Pleasure. Again, normal.

189
01:08:40,067 --> 01:08:44,434
In its extreme,
it can lead to addiction.

190
01:08:44,434 --> 01:08:45,934
Fear, which of course,

191
01:08:45,934 --> 01:08:48,300
is appropriate
in dangerous situations

192
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:50,400
as a protective mechanism,

193
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:53,601
in its exaggerated form,
can lead to anxiety,

194
01:08:53,601 --> 01:08:55,234
different kinds of phobias,

195
01:08:55,234 --> 01:08:57,667
even panic attacks
or panic disorder.

196
01:08:57,667 --> 01:09:00,901
And worry, in itself,
when it's out of control,

197
01:09:00,901 --> 01:09:04,434
and when it's extreme, can lead
to generalized anxiety disorder.

198
01:09:04,434 --> 01:09:07,501
So we can really appreciate
that the emotions

199
01:09:07,501 --> 01:09:12,667
shift and move along a continuum
from normal to extreme.

200
01:09:12,667 --> 01:09:16,033
The br--Emotion and the brain.

201
01:09:16,033 --> 01:09:18,701
Well, we know when people
have different emotions

202
01:09:18,701 --> 01:09:22,667
it manifests in, uh, the--
in brain circuitry.

203
01:09:22,667 --> 01:09:25,968
And specifically,
different functional areas.

204
01:09:25,968 --> 01:09:29,701
In this case, really the focus
over the past several decades

205
01:09:29,701 --> 01:09:32,534
has been on the emotion-related
brain circuitry

206
01:09:32,534 --> 01:09:33,968
in the limbic system,

207
01:09:33,968 --> 01:09:35,667
which is really
a distributed set

208
01:09:35,667 --> 01:09:39,634
of brain nodes or brain regions
that function together

209
01:09:39,634 --> 01:09:41,601
to have the experience
of emotions,

210
01:09:41,601 --> 01:09:45,434
and maybe even
to generate emotion experience.

211
01:09:45,434 --> 01:09:47,801
And to detect
what's personally salient

212
01:09:47,801 --> 01:09:49,734
and emotionally
significant for us.

213
01:09:49,734 --> 01:09:52,200
So this is happening
in a distributed brain system.

214
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:55,534
What you see here
in bright red is the amygdala,

215
01:09:55,534 --> 01:09:57,434
the left and right amygdala,
which is,

216
01:09:57,434 --> 01:10:00,634
as probably everyone here knows,
is a very important node

217
01:10:00,634 --> 01:10:03,067
within this limbic system
for emotions.

218
01:10:03,067 --> 01:10:04,534
Here, just to flesh
it out a little more,

219
01:10:04,534 --> 01:10:08,234
the limbic system really is
made up of multiple brain areas,

220
01:10:08,234 --> 01:10:11,434
including the amygdala,
hippocampus, hypothalamus,

221
01:10:11,434 --> 01:10:12,434
and other brain regions.

222
01:10:12,434 --> 01:10:14,167
And even other
paralimbic regions

223
01:10:14,167 --> 01:10:15,868
like the orbital frontal cortex.

224
01:10:15,868 --> 01:10:18,000
So we're only beginning
to really understand

225
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,968
how these different
brain circuitries

226
01:10:19,968 --> 01:10:22,033
contribute to different
kinds of emotion

227
01:10:22,033 --> 01:10:26,067
and the ability to work
with our emotions.

228
01:10:26,067 --> 01:10:28,734
So, having said that, how do we
actually measure emotion?

229
01:10:28,734 --> 01:10:31,734
Well, many, many different ways.

230
01:10:31,734 --> 01:10:34,400
One way, as you see here,
is actually

231
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:38,267
taking first-person,
subjective emotion experience

232
01:10:38,267 --> 01:10:40,067
from moment to moment to moment.

233
01:10:40,067 --> 01:10:41,934
Here you can see
it's actually oscillating

234
01:10:41,934 --> 01:10:45,634
from neutral to amused to sad,

235
01:10:45,634 --> 01:10:49,167
and this is being induced
by watching film clips.

236
01:10:49,167 --> 01:10:51,033
So this is subjective
emotion experience.

237
01:10:51,033 --> 01:10:52,400
First-person report.

238
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:55,567
That's one window into emotion.

239
01:10:55,567 --> 01:11:00,200
Another way is using peripheral
autonomic psychophysiology.

240
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:04,901
Skin conductants,
facial muscle contractions,

241
01:11:04,901 --> 01:11:06,400
heart rate, breathing rate--

242
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,901
These are all autonomic
psychophysiological measures

243
01:11:08,901 --> 01:11:10,234
that we can use.

244
01:11:10,234 --> 01:11:12,801
Another way is literally
looking at facial expressions.

245
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:14,868
Of fear, for example.

246
01:11:14,868 --> 01:11:17,267
Another method is, uh--
which I will be talking about--

247
01:11:17,267 --> 01:11:18,767
is functional neuroimaging.

248
01:11:18,767 --> 01:11:20,667
Using, for example,
brain imaging techniques

249
01:11:20,667 --> 01:11:23,767
to look at an index
of neural activity.

250
01:11:23,767 --> 01:11:26,501
Here it's shown
as bilateral amygdala.

251
01:11:26,501 --> 01:11:29,100
And then another method
that's relatively--

252
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:31,167
Well, no, actually it's been
used for several decades--

253
01:11:31,167 --> 01:11:33,434
is literally putting
a grid of electrodes

254
01:11:33,434 --> 01:11:38,033
right on the cortex
to measure under the skull.

255
01:11:38,033 --> 01:11:39,701
And of course,
this is an invasive procedure,

256
01:11:39,701 --> 01:11:41,467
so it's only done,
you know, during epilepsy.

257
01:11:41,467 --> 01:11:43,234
It's not done
to study emotions by itself.

258
01:11:43,234 --> 01:11:44,234
Not to worry.
[chuckling]

259
01:11:44,234 --> 01:11:46,300
Brain imaging techniques
like fMRI,

260
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:47,601
which I'll talk about,
is wonderful

261
01:11:47,601 --> 01:11:50,534
because we can go
under the skull noninvasively.

262
01:11:50,534 --> 01:11:52,400
No harm.

263
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:55,901
Uh, just to drive
home the point,

264
01:11:55,901 --> 01:11:57,667
when we talk
about different emotions,

265
01:11:57,667 --> 01:11:58,901
this is one study we did

266
01:11:58,901 --> 01:12:02,534
where we had neutral, sad,
and amusing film clips.

267
01:12:02,534 --> 01:12:05,300
Brain imaging, fMRI signal,
what's called "BOLD,"

268
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:07,434
the blood oxygen level
dependence signal.

269
01:12:07,434 --> 01:12:11,033
First-person emotion ratings
from moment to moment,

270
01:12:11,033 --> 01:12:13,534
heart rate,
and then breathing rate

271
01:12:13,534 --> 01:12:14,801
or breathing intensity.

272
01:12:14,801 --> 01:12:17,000
And this is just
to really make the point

273
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,033
that this is a dynamic,
interactive system.

274
01:12:20,033 --> 01:12:21,400
And this is only four channels.

275
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:23,467
There are many other channels
that we often look at--

276
01:12:23,467 --> 01:12:25,567
can look at as well.

277
01:12:25,567 --> 01:12:28,567
Um, a full explanation
of a phenomena

278
01:12:28,567 --> 01:12:31,000
would really go
from looking at the genes

279
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,734
or genetic contribution,
to molecules, to neurons,

280
01:12:33,734 --> 01:12:39,067
neural circuitry, and then how
different cognitive processes--

281
01:12:39,067 --> 01:12:41,400
thinking, decision making,
emotion, behavior--

282
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:44,167
are instantiated
in those neural circuitry.

283
01:12:44,167 --> 01:12:48,367
For today's talk, I'm only gonna
be talking about the top two.

284
01:12:48,367 --> 01:12:50,534
But a full explanation
really is from genetics

285
01:12:50,534 --> 01:12:52,968
all the way up
to interpersonal interactions.

286
01:12:52,968 --> 01:12:54,767
And currently we have
the technology

287
01:12:54,767 --> 01:12:57,567
to look at all of that.

288
01:12:57,567 --> 01:13:01,467
Many different modalities
of functional brain imaging.

289
01:13:01,467 --> 01:13:02,534
There are many different tools.

290
01:13:02,534 --> 01:13:04,100
They all have
their pros and cons,

291
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:05,367
strengths and weaknesses.

292
01:13:05,367 --> 01:13:06,701
What we'll be
looking at is--

293
01:13:06,701 --> 01:13:09,300
in the black box is referring
to the orange circle--

294
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:13,267
is fMRI, functional magnetic
resonance imaging.

295
01:13:13,267 --> 01:13:16,367
So that gives us a signal
on the order of seconds

296
01:13:16,367 --> 01:13:18,834
across the entire brain, um,

297
01:13:18,834 --> 01:13:22,501
and approximately we get
the unit that we can analyze.

298
01:13:22,501 --> 01:13:27,033
It's approximately two-three
millimeters of voxels.

299
01:13:27,033 --> 01:13:29,200
So it has its pros and cons,
but it's noninvasive,

300
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:30,467
and that's what we use.

301
01:13:30,467 --> 01:13:31,667
Now, if no one here is--

302
01:13:31,667 --> 01:13:33,234
If you've not been
in an MRI machine,

303
01:13:33,234 --> 01:13:34,400
essentially it's a magnet.

304
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:35,934
And it's a beautiful,
elegant machine,

305
01:13:35,934 --> 01:13:37,334
but it's a magnet.

306
01:13:37,334 --> 01:13:39,167
And you can see that people
are lying down on their back

307
01:13:39,167 --> 01:13:41,300
and we put them inside
the bore of the magnet.

308
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:44,501
And I'm gonna give you
a one-slide primer

309
01:13:44,501 --> 01:13:48,601
on the dependent variable
in fMRI.

310
01:13:48,601 --> 01:13:50,334
So you're lying in the scanner,

311
01:13:50,334 --> 01:13:54,267
you have this angry,
harsh, critical face,

312
01:13:54,267 --> 01:13:56,400
presented to you,
you're perceiving it.

313
01:13:56,400 --> 01:14:00,367
This sets off firing in specific
populations of neurons

314
01:14:00,367 --> 01:14:04,334
that activate neural circuitry--
distributed neural circuits--

315
01:14:04,334 --> 01:14:07,167
that then are consuming
glucose and oxygen,

316
01:14:07,167 --> 01:14:08,667
send a signal downstream--

317
01:14:08,667 --> 01:14:13,100
"Hey, the neurons are firing,"
send more cerebral blood volume,

318
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:16,167
more blood flow,
and specifically,

319
01:14:16,167 --> 01:14:20,501
more oxygenated hemoglobin
and, um, glucose.

320
01:14:20,501 --> 01:14:23,033
So that the neurons
can continue to fire

321
01:14:23,033 --> 01:14:25,067
and you can replenish
what's been used.

322
01:14:25,067 --> 01:14:28,567
Then they do a lot of signal
processing and statistics

323
01:14:28,567 --> 01:14:30,501
to create brain maps,

324
01:14:30,501 --> 01:14:32,434
which you've seen
in magazines, I'm sure,

325
01:14:32,434 --> 01:14:37,000
to actually infer the underlying
neural activity that's occurring

326
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,767
in response to looking
at an angry face.

327
01:14:39,767 --> 01:14:41,000
And then we use functional--

328
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,634
our knowledge
of functional neural anatomy

329
01:14:42,634 --> 01:14:43,767
to try to infer

330
01:14:43,767 --> 01:14:45,367
what these different
brain systems are doing

331
01:14:45,367 --> 01:14:48,834
in conjunction with specific
experimental design

332
01:14:48,834 --> 01:14:53,100
to tease out the function
of different brain activity.

333
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:56,467
That's a one-slide primer.

334
01:14:56,467 --> 01:15:00,667
So, there are many ways
to probe the brain.

335
01:15:00,667 --> 01:15:02,300
And specifically to look

336
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:05,767
at the emotion-related brain
regions in the limbic system.

337
01:15:05,767 --> 01:15:07,667
One way would be
dynamic social feedback,

338
01:15:07,667 --> 01:15:10,167
so you can imagine a person
in a video clip looking at you,

339
01:15:10,167 --> 01:15:13,767
going, "People don't
really like you."

340
01:15:13,767 --> 01:15:15,067
That's one method.

341
01:15:15,067 --> 01:15:18,734
Especially for people
who are socially sensitive.

342
01:15:18,734 --> 01:15:20,501
You could also use music.

343
01:15:20,501 --> 01:15:24,367
Studies have used both
positive and really sad music

344
01:15:24,367 --> 01:15:27,901
to induce very rapid shifts
in emotional state.

345
01:15:27,901 --> 01:15:29,634
And you can just
check your own experience

346
01:15:29,634 --> 01:15:31,100
listening to different songs--

347
01:15:31,100 --> 01:15:33,300
Bruce Springsteen songs
or whatever.

348
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:34,968
Uh, another way
as we've already shown

349
01:15:34,968 --> 01:15:36,667
is facial expressions,

350
01:15:36,667 --> 01:15:40,868
because we are super sensitive
to the slightest shifts,

351
01:15:40,868 --> 01:15:42,667
whether we're
aware of it or not,

352
01:15:42,667 --> 01:15:45,133
in peoples' facial expressions.

353
01:15:45,133 --> 01:15:46,567
Electric shock.

354
01:15:46,567 --> 01:15:50,534
A very powerful--especially
the anticipation of the shock,

355
01:15:50,534 --> 01:15:52,501
even if you don't
deliver a shock,

356
01:15:52,501 --> 01:15:56,701
sets up all kinds of anxiety
and fear and defensive responses

357
01:15:56,701 --> 01:15:59,100
that you can begin
to measure in the brain.

358
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:03,300
Another method that's closer
to what we do in psychotherapy

359
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:07,934
or clinical practice is peoples'
own negative self-beliefs.

360
01:16:07,934 --> 01:16:11,033
So, for example,
"something is wrong with me."

361
01:16:11,033 --> 01:16:13,367
Having that thought
spinning in the mind

362
01:16:13,367 --> 01:16:16,200
can actually induce activity
in the limbic system,

363
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:18,968
and is really the basis of what
we begin to work with in, um--

364
01:16:18,968 --> 01:16:20,634
for people
with depression and anxiety.

365
01:16:20,634 --> 01:16:22,234
What are the core
negative beliefs?

366
01:16:22,234 --> 01:16:24,434
So these are--this is just
a sampling of different methods

367
01:16:24,434 --> 01:16:25,901
that can be used to probe

368
01:16:25,901 --> 01:16:28,701
the function
of the limbic system.

369
01:16:28,701 --> 01:16:30,033
But then there's
a whole other part.

370
01:16:30,033 --> 01:16:32,734
This beautiful prefrontal cortex

371
01:16:32,734 --> 01:16:35,501
that is so fully developed
in the human animals,

372
01:16:35,501 --> 01:16:37,667
which allows us
to take perspective.

373
01:16:37,667 --> 01:16:41,234
To think, to analyze,
to use language.

374
01:16:41,234 --> 01:16:43,901
All in the service
of emotion regulation.

375
01:16:43,901 --> 01:16:47,367
In what ways can we actually
think in a certain way

376
01:16:47,367 --> 01:16:49,300
that helps to change the meaning

377
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:51,634
of something that's
going on right now in our life.

378
01:16:51,634 --> 01:16:53,033
Or even right this moment.

379
01:16:53,033 --> 01:16:56,400
To change its intensity,
to change its duration.

380
01:16:56,400 --> 01:17:01,100
To even shift our interpretation
of what that emotion is doing

381
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:02,634
and why we're having it.

382
01:17:02,634 --> 01:17:05,901
That's this prefrontal cortical
area that allows us

383
01:17:05,901 --> 01:17:07,901
to make abstractions, think,

384
01:17:07,901 --> 01:17:11,234
take perspective,
apply different strategies.

385
01:17:11,234 --> 01:17:12,567
But this is not new.

386
01:17:12,567 --> 01:17:17,267
Almost two millennia ago,
Marcus Aurelius said,

387
01:17:17,267 --> 01:17:20,767
"If you are distressed
by anything external,

388
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:22,334
"or even internal,

389
01:17:22,334 --> 01:17:25,634
"the pain is not
due to the thing itself,

390
01:17:25,634 --> 01:17:27,501
"but to your estimate of it,

391
01:17:27,501 --> 01:17:30,868
"and this you have the power
to revoke at any moment."

392
01:17:30,868 --> 01:17:34,501
Profound, profound statement.

393
01:17:34,501 --> 01:17:37,033
Definition
of emotion regulation.

394
01:17:37,033 --> 01:17:40,067
So it's not a new phenomena
in human animals,

395
01:17:40,067 --> 01:17:42,634
it's been here
for thousands of years.

396
01:17:42,634 --> 01:17:43,934
But this is really
something specific

397
01:17:43,934 --> 01:17:45,934
about our prefrontal cortex
that allows us

398
01:17:45,934 --> 01:17:50,567
to work with these processes
to modify our experience

399
01:17:50,567 --> 01:17:52,200
from moment to moment.

400
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:55,834
So, there are different stages
of emotion regulation.

401
01:17:55,834 --> 01:17:59,167
And just, as I'm saying this,
check your own experience.

402
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:00,634
Pre-conscious.

403
01:18:00,634 --> 01:18:03,467
Are there proclivities
or even cognioprocesses

404
01:18:03,467 --> 01:18:07,033
that are happening in the brain
when a situation is occurring

405
01:18:07,033 --> 01:18:09,701
even before we are aware of it

406
01:18:09,701 --> 01:18:12,901
that's influencing
how we interpret our emotions,

407
01:18:12,901 --> 01:18:16,133
how we interpret
our current situation?

408
01:18:16,133 --> 01:18:19,434
Then this leads to immediate
attentional shifts

409
01:18:19,434 --> 01:18:22,133
when it bursts
into conscious processing--

410
01:18:22,133 --> 01:18:24,534
Something scary is going on.
There's threat.

411
01:18:24,534 --> 01:18:27,434
Do I shift my attention
to the source of threat?

412
01:18:27,434 --> 01:18:28,567
Social approach.

413
01:18:28,567 --> 01:18:30,400
Do I shift my attention away?

414
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:31,567
Avoidance.

415
01:18:31,567 --> 01:18:33,067
Both of which are forms--

416
01:18:33,067 --> 01:18:35,501
can be forms of regulating
my attention,

417
01:18:35,501 --> 01:18:38,467
and which thereby
influences emotions.

418
01:18:38,467 --> 01:18:40,767
Another aspect
is emotion appraisal.

419
01:18:40,767 --> 01:18:42,601
How do I label that emotion?

420
01:18:42,601 --> 01:18:46,000
How do I interpret
what that emotion is?

421
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,167
And then cognitive reappraisal.

422
01:18:48,167 --> 01:18:50,701
Using our thinking
and perspective-taking ability

423
01:18:50,701 --> 01:18:52,100
to change the meaning.

424
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:53,534
"Oh, that's not
a source of threat,

425
01:18:53,534 --> 01:18:56,167
"it's only a stick or a rope,
it's not a snake."

426
01:18:56,167 --> 01:18:59,100
"Oh, that person was only--
was looking at somebody else,"

427
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:01,300
"Not at me."

428
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:04,501
And then finally,
and more subtly, meta-cognitive.

429
01:19:04,501 --> 01:19:08,367
How I view
how I process thinking.

430
01:19:08,367 --> 01:19:11,968
How I view my ability
to create a space

431
01:19:11,968 --> 01:19:14,300
to understand how my mind works.

432
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:16,968
So more meta-cognitive
processes, which can--

433
01:19:16,968 --> 01:19:20,400
All of these things that we're
talking here can be trained.

434
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:23,300
Through different practices.

435
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:26,000
Little bit about
the neuroanatomy.

436
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,868
Some wonderful work
by Mary Phillips, Helen Mayburg,

437
01:19:29,868 --> 01:19:33,234
Wayne Drevets, Kevin Ochsner,
on and on and on.

438
01:19:33,234 --> 01:19:35,634
Some fantastic neuroscientists
who really have,

439
01:19:35,634 --> 01:19:40,300
in the past 10-15 years,
begun to create models--

440
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:42,667
brain anatomy
and functional anatomy models

441
01:19:42,667 --> 01:19:45,467
of emotion reactivity
and regulation.

442
01:19:45,467 --> 01:19:50,834
So in the context of a threat,
real or imagined,

443
01:19:50,834 --> 01:19:54,167
this can rapidly shift
our affective state.

444
01:19:54,167 --> 01:19:57,367
Fear, anxiety, arousal.

445
01:19:57,367 --> 01:19:58,934
And this is really embedded

446
01:19:58,934 --> 01:20:01,868
in the emotional reactivity
in the limbic system.

447
01:20:01,868 --> 01:20:04,601
Amygdala.
Anterior Cingulate.

448
01:20:04,601 --> 01:20:06,334
This sends a bottom-up signal

449
01:20:06,334 --> 01:20:08,868
to recruit help from
other parts of the brain.

450
01:20:08,868 --> 01:20:10,367
Other brain systems.

451
01:20:10,367 --> 01:20:12,701
When that's working correctly,
then in blue,

452
01:20:12,701 --> 01:20:15,033
see here that there are
regulatory systems

453
01:20:15,033 --> 01:20:18,133
that then begin to process
what is that threat?

454
01:20:18,133 --> 01:20:20,367
What are some strategies?
How can I work with it?

455
01:20:20,367 --> 01:20:23,934
And when it's working well,
it sends a top-down signal

456
01:20:23,934 --> 01:20:28,100
to modulate the intensity,
the duration, the interpretation

457
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:31,801
of that ongoing
emotion experience.

458
01:20:31,801 --> 01:20:35,000
But I would also add
that especially in human beings,

459
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,801
This is mediated
through our view of self,

460
01:20:37,801 --> 01:20:40,767
be it positive
or negative or otherwise,

461
01:20:40,767 --> 01:20:43,200
and our ability to use
language and thinking

462
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:46,334
To modulate and understand
our experiences.

463
01:20:46,334 --> 01:20:49,133
So this is a beginning
of a complex system

464
01:20:49,133 --> 01:20:51,033
that people are
beginning to, um, examine

465
01:20:51,033 --> 01:20:53,801
using all kinds
of neuroscientific tools.

466
01:20:53,801 --> 01:20:55,434
Terms of emotional intelligence,

467
01:20:55,434 --> 01:20:58,300
which is a relatively
new concept,

468
01:20:58,300 --> 01:21:01,234
Um, Peter Salovey and John Mayer

469
01:21:01,234 --> 01:21:03,801
have defined it
in the following way...

470
01:21:03,801 --> 01:21:06,067
It is the ability to monitor

471
01:21:06,067 --> 01:21:11,767
one's own and others'
feelings and emotions,

472
01:21:11,767 --> 01:21:14,534
to discriminate among them,

473
01:21:14,534 --> 01:21:16,601
and to use this information

474
01:21:16,601 --> 01:21:19,601
to guide one's
thinking and actions

475
01:21:19,601 --> 01:21:23,300
in a way that is not harming,
and hopefully helping,

476
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:24,901
others and self.

477
01:21:24,901 --> 01:21:28,534
So this is very fundamental
to human social interaction,

478
01:21:28,534 --> 01:21:32,934
human systems,
Google, the world.

479
01:21:32,934 --> 01:21:35,234
But this really relies
on previous work

480
01:21:35,234 --> 01:21:38,868
by Howard Gardner, who had
a very, very influential book

481
01:21:38,868 --> 01:21:41,501
where he talked
about multiple intelligences.

482
01:21:41,501 --> 01:21:44,000
So in cognitive psychology,
clinical psychology,

483
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,601
we often talk about IQ.

484
01:21:45,601 --> 01:21:48,934
Intellectual
cognitive abilities.

485
01:21:48,934 --> 01:21:51,734
But of course, there are many
other kinds of intelligences

486
01:21:51,734 --> 01:21:54,000
which are as important,
and in some situations

487
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,267
even more important,

488
01:21:55,267 --> 01:21:58,834
in the domains of interpersonal
skills and intelligence,

489
01:21:58,834 --> 01:22:01,767
and also intrapersonal skills.

490
01:22:01,767 --> 01:22:04,634
So the idea is that there are
multiple forms of intelligence,

491
01:22:04,634 --> 01:22:07,267
and that these are important

492
01:22:07,267 --> 01:22:09,968
to develop volitionally,
intentionally,

493
01:22:09,968 --> 01:22:11,901
and to find methods
to actually work on that,

494
01:22:11,901 --> 01:22:16,234
to be come a more full,
skillful, optimal human being.

495
01:22:16,234 --> 01:22:18,434
Um, some of the skills
and competencies

496
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:20,067
that we're thinking about,

497
01:22:20,067 --> 01:22:21,968
especially in
Search Inside Yourself...

498
01:22:21,968 --> 01:22:23,200
Emotional awareness.

499
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:25,400
The inverse of that
is alexithymia.

500
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:28,200
The inability to detect
and even describe

501
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:31,634
one's own emotional states,
let alone others'.

502
01:22:31,634 --> 01:22:33,033
Mindfulness.

503
01:22:33,033 --> 01:22:36,100
The ability to volitionally
place one's attention

504
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:41,200
in the moment on purpose
from moment to moment

505
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:45,934
without negative critical
self-judgment.

506
01:22:45,934 --> 01:22:47,567
Self-awareness.

507
01:22:47,567 --> 01:22:50,000
Enriching and enhancing
our understanding

508
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,467
of what actually--
"who actually am I?"

509
01:22:52,467 --> 01:22:54,167
"How do I function?"

510
01:22:54,167 --> 01:22:55,434
And the ability to regulate.

511
01:22:55,434 --> 01:22:58,868
When I am off-balance,
do I know how to regulate

512
01:22:58,868 --> 01:23:00,801
and bring myself
back into balance?

513
01:23:00,801 --> 01:23:02,133
Off-balance, back into balance.

514
01:23:02,133 --> 01:23:04,400
That's a whole set of skills.

515
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:05,501
Motivation.

516
01:23:05,501 --> 01:23:07,067
What's the motivation
or intention

517
01:23:07,067 --> 01:23:08,868
for engaging in action?

518
01:23:08,868 --> 01:23:12,000
Behavior?
Interactions with other people?

519
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,434
Empathy.

520
01:23:13,434 --> 01:23:17,367
As we'll see in a moment,
the ability to actually tune in

521
01:23:17,367 --> 01:23:19,601
and feel the reverberation,
so to speak,

522
01:23:19,601 --> 01:23:22,133
of the emotional state
of another person.

523
01:23:22,133 --> 01:23:27,567
Dropping the self just enough
to attend to someone else

524
01:23:27,567 --> 01:23:29,567
in deeper and deeper ways.

525
01:23:29,567 --> 01:23:31,234
And then social skills.

526
01:23:31,234 --> 01:23:34,467
Both linguistic,
language, body language,

527
01:23:34,467 --> 01:23:36,734
um, even vocabulary.

528
01:23:36,734 --> 01:23:40,767
And also just being able
to evaluate and take feedback.

529
01:23:40,767 --> 01:23:42,167
So all of these
are in the service

530
01:23:42,167 --> 01:23:46,567
of enhancing psychological
flexibility and well-being.

531
01:23:46,567 --> 01:23:48,934
So, I did a lit search,
and there are not

532
01:23:48,934 --> 01:23:51,868
that many studies
on emotional intelligence

533
01:23:51,868 --> 01:23:53,334
and brain functioning.

534
01:23:53,334 --> 01:23:54,834
But one that caught my eye
is the following,

535
01:23:54,834 --> 01:23:57,200
which is done
by Killgore and colleagues.

536
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:59,367
This--In this particular
study they worked

537
01:23:59,367 --> 01:24:04,133
with 16 healthy children
and adolescents,

538
01:24:04,133 --> 01:24:08,434
and they had to do processing
of fear facial expressions.

539
01:24:08,434 --> 01:24:09,434
Here's one example.

540
01:24:09,434 --> 01:24:11,934
So, fear face expressions.

541
01:24:11,934 --> 01:24:13,167
Processing those.

542
01:24:13,167 --> 01:24:15,200
What they found is

543
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:18,334
on one of many emotional
intelligence questionnaires,

544
01:24:18,334 --> 01:24:21,934
the more emotionally intelligent
via self-report questionnaire

545
01:24:21,934 --> 01:24:25,601
that these kids demonstrated--

546
01:24:25,601 --> 01:24:29,200
This was associated
with a reduction--blue--

547
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:31,334
a reduction in brain activity

548
01:24:31,334 --> 01:24:33,801
in a distributed
set of brain systems

549
01:24:33,801 --> 01:24:38,667
that had to do with, um,
somatic or sensory experience,

550
01:24:38,667 --> 01:24:43,067
emotion reactivity, and even
kind of cognitive control.

551
01:24:43,067 --> 01:24:45,701
So reduction in the need
to try to control

552
01:24:45,701 --> 01:24:50,267
to viscerally feel,
and--in red--

553
01:24:50,267 --> 01:24:53,834
enhanced activity in some
of the visual processing areas

554
01:24:53,834 --> 01:24:58,133
as a function of reporting
greater emotional intelligence.

555
01:24:58,133 --> 01:25:00,834
So this is one study,
but it's very promising

556
01:25:00,834 --> 01:25:03,567
to see even in a younger
sample of children

557
01:25:03,567 --> 01:25:07,000
that emotional intelligence
have correlates

558
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,601
in the brain
that are interpretable

559
01:25:08,601 --> 01:25:12,567
and important in terms of
emotion and sensory experience.

560
01:25:12,567 --> 01:25:14,000
Empathy.

561
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:17,300
So, I said that we'd talk
a little bit about empathy.

562
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:19,601
So, currently, it's a hot field.

563
01:25:19,601 --> 01:25:21,534
It's a hot area
within neuroscience.

564
01:25:21,534 --> 01:25:24,300
A decade ago,
no one would've touched this.

565
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:26,901
So this is really talking
about a paradigm shift

566
01:25:26,901 --> 01:25:29,133
among scientists who,
by definition,

567
01:25:29,133 --> 01:25:31,534
tend to be rather
conservative in what we study,

568
01:25:31,534 --> 01:25:33,601
but understanding
that we now have the tools

569
01:25:33,601 --> 01:25:37,100
to be able to begin
to dissect, deconstruct,

570
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:39,300
manipulate levels of empathy.

571
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:40,634
So here, we can under--

572
01:25:40,634 --> 01:25:44,000
How can we understand
the other person's mind?

573
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:47,067
You can say theory of mind
is one aspect of this.

574
01:25:47,067 --> 01:25:49,300
And what
is the neurocircuitry involved?

575
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:52,434
So, empathy,
I would say, really relies

576
01:25:52,434 --> 01:25:55,234
on a bunch of earlier
developed skills,

577
01:25:55,234 --> 01:25:56,767
in fact, some that are innate.

578
01:25:56,767 --> 01:25:57,901
So, what I'm putting here

579
01:25:57,901 --> 01:26:00,934
is a picture that shows
that children, infants

580
01:26:00,934 --> 01:26:05,400
actually can imitate
imitation, facial expressions,

581
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:08,501
and motor movements in adults.

582
01:26:08,501 --> 01:26:10,000
This is a very important clue.

583
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,501
So now we're
becoming detectives.

584
01:26:11,501 --> 01:26:16,000
The ability to perceive others
and to imitate their behaviors

585
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:20,133
is a building block for empathy.

586
01:26:20,133 --> 01:26:25,100
In fact, some studies have shown
that there's a frontal cortex

587
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:28,434
to parietal network
that's implicated

588
01:26:28,434 --> 01:26:30,467
in mirror neuron systems

589
01:26:30,467 --> 01:26:32,000
for the ability
to perceive others

590
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,334
and to imitate their behaviors
and their actions.

591
01:26:35,334 --> 01:26:37,300
So when you see kids,
for example,

592
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:38,734
sticking their tongues
at each other,

593
01:26:38,734 --> 01:26:41,167
there's in fact
a brain network--

594
01:26:41,167 --> 01:26:44,200
the yellow part has to do
with visual information

595
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:47,033
feeding the red--
the two red areas

596
01:26:47,033 --> 01:26:49,934
that have to do with generating
the motor pattern

597
01:26:49,934 --> 01:26:52,868
and then understanding
how my motor pattern

598
01:26:52,868 --> 01:26:56,033
matches what
another person is doing.

599
01:26:56,033 --> 01:26:59,567
Observation of an action
automatically triggers

600
01:26:59,567 --> 01:27:01,734
simulation of that action
in the brain.

601
01:27:01,734 --> 01:27:05,634
Even if it's not expressed.

602
01:27:05,634 --> 01:27:09,667
Premotor cortical neurons fire
during goal-directed actions

603
01:27:09,667 --> 01:27:12,267
as well as during
observation of similar actions.

604
01:27:12,267 --> 01:27:15,300
So throughout the day,
as we observe others,

605
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:19,501
parts of our brain are actually
setting up simulations

606
01:27:19,501 --> 01:27:23,300
that mirror other
peoples' behaviors.

607
01:27:23,300 --> 01:27:25,601
And we'll say that the neural
bases of imitation,

608
01:27:25,601 --> 01:27:28,367
as shown here,
is really a basis for empathy,

609
01:27:28,367 --> 01:27:31,267
which, in one way,
is an inner imitation

610
01:27:31,267 --> 01:27:33,801
of the emotional state
of another person.

611
01:27:33,801 --> 01:27:36,334
So we actually have
the neural bases

612
01:27:36,334 --> 01:27:37,767
that we can begin to probe

613
01:27:37,767 --> 01:27:40,434
and see how they
change with training.

614
01:27:40,434 --> 01:27:43,634
So empathy here can be
construed as identification

615
01:27:43,634 --> 01:27:47,267
with and understanding
of another's situation,

616
01:27:47,267 --> 01:27:50,133
feelings, motives, intentions.

617
01:27:50,133 --> 01:27:53,267
The state of being in tune
with another person,

618
01:27:53,267 --> 01:27:56,400
particularly by feeling
what their situation is like

619
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:58,033
from the inside.

620
01:27:58,033 --> 01:28:00,067
Not just intellectually.

621
01:28:00,067 --> 01:28:01,868
And empathy--
this is interesting--

622
01:28:01,868 --> 01:28:03,968
may or may not precede sympathy,

623
01:28:03,968 --> 01:28:09,267
which is a basis
for developing the ability

624
01:28:09,267 --> 01:28:12,000
to cognitively understand
that person's mind,

625
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,133
how they view things.

626
01:28:13,133 --> 01:28:16,033
So empathy would be
more an affective state.

627
01:28:16,033 --> 01:28:18,801
In fact, um, this is shown here.

628
01:28:18,801 --> 01:28:22,000
One study that had to do
with looking at empathy

629
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,300
for another person's pain.

630
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:26,734
Physical pain, emotional pain,

631
01:28:26,734 --> 01:28:29,701
triggers in the perceiver,
shown here,

632
01:28:29,701 --> 01:28:33,534
brain regions associated
with emotion processing.

633
01:28:33,534 --> 01:28:37,200
Visceral experience.

634
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:39,701
Bilateral insula,
a very important area

635
01:28:39,701 --> 01:28:41,400
that has to do
with the visceral experience

636
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:44,467
when you see
someone else in pain.

637
01:28:44,467 --> 01:28:48,400
In this particular study,
people viewed short film clips

638
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:50,434
of people who
either were neutral--

639
01:28:50,434 --> 01:28:52,400
not--affectively
are not in pain--

640
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:55,200
versus people who are
in a very painful response.

641
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:58,234
Imagined the feelings
of the other person

642
01:28:58,234 --> 01:29:00,334
or even oneself
having that pain.

643
01:29:00,334 --> 01:29:01,634
And here, what I just
wanna point out,

644
01:29:01,634 --> 01:29:03,901
is that, um,
they measured two things.

645
01:29:03,901 --> 01:29:07,133
Personal distress
and empathic concern.

646
01:29:07,133 --> 01:29:10,100
And what you'll see
is the empathic concern

647
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:13,901
was much greater when you saw
the other person in pain.

648
01:29:13,901 --> 01:29:16,067
Not oneself.

649
01:29:16,067 --> 01:29:18,767
The personal distress
was greater

650
01:29:18,767 --> 01:29:22,167
when you imagined yourself
in pain, not the other.

651
01:29:22,167 --> 01:29:24,701
So here, this is a double--
this is a double dissociation

652
01:29:24,701 --> 01:29:26,701
where we can actually
begin to delineate

653
01:29:26,701 --> 01:29:30,501
different aspects of empathy,

654
01:29:30,501 --> 01:29:32,534
and where they're
playing out in the brain.

655
01:29:32,534 --> 01:29:35,434
And again, insula--
insular cortex,

656
01:29:35,434 --> 01:29:37,767
this visceral experience
of pain in others.

657
01:29:37,767 --> 01:29:40,534
So this starts
to get exciting, in fact.

658
01:29:40,534 --> 01:29:44,400
Another very important
review paper came out recently,

659
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:48,234
by Chaim and Tanya Singer,
trying to delineate

660
01:29:48,234 --> 01:29:49,534
two different aspects.

661
01:29:49,534 --> 01:29:51,767
Cognitive perspective taking,
which is something

662
01:29:51,767 --> 01:29:53,801
that we probably
are all doing many times a day

663
01:29:53,801 --> 01:29:56,400
trying to understand
what other people are thinking.

664
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:59,400
The ability to understand
intentions, desires, and beliefs

665
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:02,167
of another person,
resulting from cognitively

666
01:30:02,167 --> 01:30:04,367
reasoning
about the other's state.

667
01:30:04,367 --> 01:30:06,367
"How is this person
seeing the situation?"

668
01:30:06,367 --> 01:30:08,300
"How could they actually
do problem solving?"

669
01:30:08,300 --> 01:30:10,067
"How--What are the things
that they--

670
01:30:10,067 --> 01:30:12,701
"are important in their
process in decision making

671
01:30:12,701 --> 01:30:14,434
that lead to their behavior?"

672
01:30:14,434 --> 01:30:17,200
In contrast to that,
the empathy is really

673
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:20,567
getting
into the affective state,

674
01:30:20,567 --> 01:30:22,634
which is caused
by the sharing of the emotions

675
01:30:22,634 --> 01:30:25,033
and the sensory experience
of another person.

676
01:30:25,033 --> 01:30:29,467
Dropping the self just enough
to begin to experience

677
01:30:29,467 --> 01:30:33,534
the emotions of another person
at least to some degree.

678
01:30:33,534 --> 01:30:35,033
On some level.

679
01:30:35,033 --> 01:30:37,434
And--oop.

680
01:30:37,434 --> 01:30:40,067
So these two different
perspectives

681
01:30:40,067 --> 01:30:41,701
on how to understand
another person.

682
01:30:41,701 --> 01:30:44,534
Green and orange
are actually mapped

683
01:30:44,534 --> 01:30:47,067
onto different parts
of the brain.

684
01:30:47,067 --> 01:30:48,968
And that the cognitive
has to do

685
01:30:48,968 --> 01:30:51,033
with more medial
prefrontal cortex,

686
01:30:51,033 --> 01:30:54,767
higher order abstract mental
representations of the other,

687
01:30:54,767 --> 01:30:57,534
as well as taking--

688
01:30:57,534 --> 01:31:00,467
Actually, areas that have
to do with social cognition,

689
01:31:00,467 --> 01:31:04,033
perspective taking,
how I represent other people

690
01:31:04,033 --> 01:31:05,567
in my mind.

691
01:31:05,567 --> 01:31:07,067
Versus the orange,
which has to do

692
01:31:07,067 --> 01:31:11,200
with the anterior cingulate
and, again, the insula,

693
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:15,167
which has more to do with trying
to resolve conflict.

694
01:31:15,167 --> 01:31:19,000
Actually experience
the visceral state

695
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,701
of another person's emotion.

696
01:31:20,701 --> 01:31:23,400
So there's kind of tuning in
on an emotional level.

697
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:25,000
So the brain
is actually showing this

698
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:28,801
even without people's
first-person report.

699
01:31:28,801 --> 01:31:30,567
So this is a very
interesting way

700
01:31:30,567 --> 01:31:33,133
that the brain imaging is
leading to understanding

701
01:31:33,133 --> 01:31:34,667
about how people
are functioning

702
01:31:34,667 --> 01:31:37,834
that we may or may not be able
to verbally express

703
01:31:37,834 --> 01:31:41,434
or always reliably express
verbally, I should say.

704
01:31:41,434 --> 01:31:43,801
Um, compassion.

705
01:31:43,801 --> 01:31:46,767
So I would suggest--
and this can be open to debate

706
01:31:46,767 --> 01:31:47,968
and thinking.

707
01:31:47,968 --> 01:31:51,567
Empathy, the cognitive
perspective taking,

708
01:31:51,567 --> 01:31:53,501
are building blocks.

709
01:31:53,501 --> 01:31:57,634
Both are necessary
for developing compassion.

710
01:31:57,634 --> 01:32:00,968
Compassion being truly--

711
01:32:00,968 --> 01:32:04,033
Uh, well, I'll let the
definition come up.

712
01:32:04,033 --> 01:32:08,067
The deep awareness of the
suffering of another person

713
01:32:08,067 --> 01:32:12,267
coupled with the wish,
the intention, the motivation

714
01:32:12,267 --> 01:32:14,934
to relieve that person
from their suffering.

715
01:32:14,934 --> 01:32:17,567
So it's both
an emotional component

716
01:32:17,567 --> 01:32:20,133
and a cognitive component.

717
01:32:20,133 --> 01:32:21,767
A tender feeling.

718
01:32:21,767 --> 01:32:26,467
Sympathetic, sad concern
for someone in misfortune.

719
01:32:26,467 --> 01:32:30,501
Pity for others
with a desire to help.

720
01:32:30,501 --> 01:32:34,033
And I would
pause it here and bold

721
01:32:34,033 --> 01:32:36,501
that empathy and cognitive
perspective taking

722
01:32:36,501 --> 01:32:42,234
and behavioral action is really
the crux of compassion.

723
01:32:42,234 --> 01:32:43,868
And this can be trained.

724
01:32:43,868 --> 01:32:46,067
So it's the emotion,
the cognition,

725
01:32:46,067 --> 01:32:51,133
and the action
to relieve others of suffering.

726
01:32:51,133 --> 01:32:54,701
Compassion doesn't mean
we have to become angelic.

727
01:32:54,701 --> 01:32:56,133
Angels.

728
01:32:56,133 --> 01:32:57,834
And I put this up here because
that's actually

729
01:32:57,834 --> 01:32:59,868
an obstacle
to even thinking about,

730
01:32:59,868 --> 01:33:02,167
"How can I become more
compassionate at work,

731
01:33:02,167 --> 01:33:04,434
at home,
in my relationships?"

732
01:33:04,434 --> 01:33:07,400
If a goal is too lofty,
I'll stop from the beginning.

733
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:09,567
This is not the case.

734
01:33:09,567 --> 01:33:14,200
The absence of compassion can
lead to incredible...

735
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:16,467
painful...

736
01:33:16,467 --> 01:33:18,901
decisions to abuse other people.

737
01:33:18,901 --> 01:33:23,868
As we see in Abu Ghraib
in this picture.

738
01:33:23,868 --> 01:33:28,434
But also, in this same field
in the theater of war,

739
01:33:28,434 --> 01:33:30,334
there can be moments
of compassion

740
01:33:30,334 --> 01:33:34,267
where a person decides
to pause enough for a moment

741
01:33:34,267 --> 01:33:35,968
to connect with others.

742
01:33:35,968 --> 01:33:37,300
So this is really important.

743
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:38,934
This is not just theoretical.

744
01:33:38,934 --> 01:33:41,501
This is actually playing
out from moment to moment

745
01:33:41,501 --> 01:33:46,968
either in very safe environments
like Google or Mountain View

746
01:33:46,968 --> 01:33:48,834
or in very dangerous
environments

747
01:33:48,834 --> 01:33:52,834
like East Palo Alto or Iraq
or Afghanistan

748
01:33:52,834 --> 01:33:54,467
and everywhere in between.

749
01:33:54,467 --> 01:33:55,934
So this is not theoretical.

750
01:33:55,934 --> 01:33:58,067
This is actually fundamental.

751
01:33:58,067 --> 01:34:00,234
In fact, one quote here.

752
01:34:00,234 --> 01:34:02,734
"I feel the capacity
to care is the thing

753
01:34:02,734 --> 01:34:08,234
which gives life
its deepest significance."

754
01:34:08,234 --> 01:34:10,100
His Holiness
the Dalai Lama says,

755
01:34:10,100 --> 01:34:14,801
"Love and compassion
are necessities, not luxuries."

756
01:34:14,801 --> 01:34:16,734
Why?

757
01:34:16,734 --> 01:34:20,234
Because, "Without them
humanity cannot survive."

758
01:34:20,234 --> 01:34:23,334
And I think that one reason
that neuroscientists,

759
01:34:23,334 --> 01:34:26,000
neurologists, psychiatrists,
psychologists,

760
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:30,334
researchers,
even physicists at Stanford,

761
01:34:30,334 --> 01:34:35,734
neurosurgeons, and beyond
are actively putting

762
01:34:35,734 --> 01:34:38,534
their intellectual resources,
their money, and their time

763
01:34:38,534 --> 01:34:39,734
into studying this.

764
01:34:39,734 --> 01:34:40,868
Why?

765
01:34:40,868 --> 01:34:42,801
Because they realize that

766
01:34:42,801 --> 01:34:44,601
this is getting
pretty serious.

767
01:34:44,601 --> 01:34:46,601
It's not a luxury.

768
01:34:46,601 --> 01:34:49,400
It's a necessity for human
animals to continue

769
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:51,367
to exist on this planet.

770
01:34:51,367 --> 01:34:53,067
So that's
why the neuroscientists

771
01:34:53,067 --> 01:34:54,934
who wouldn't have
touched this ten years ago,

772
01:34:54,934 --> 01:34:57,667
are actively studying this now
because now

773
01:34:57,667 --> 01:35:00,801
we need to do more
and we can do more.

774
01:35:00,801 --> 01:35:04,701
In fact, what do people
at Google say?

775
01:35:04,701 --> 01:35:07,400
The Googlers say,
"Don't be evil."

776
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:09,100
How wonderful.

777
01:35:09,100 --> 01:35:11,667
At least do not harm others.

778
01:35:11,667 --> 01:35:16,234
And if you can, if possible,
bring some benefit to others.

779
01:35:16,234 --> 01:35:18,334
So I like your motto.

780
01:35:18,334 --> 01:35:22,767
EEG, another imaging tool.

781
01:35:22,767 --> 01:35:24,868
Different capacities.

782
01:35:24,868 --> 01:35:27,868
Can we look at people who worked
on training their minds?

783
01:35:27,868 --> 01:35:29,334
Well, the answer is yes.

784
01:35:29,334 --> 01:35:32,133
When people are doing
loving-kindness meditation,

785
01:35:32,133 --> 01:35:35,734
which is one kind of compassion
meditation practice,

786
01:35:35,734 --> 01:35:37,901
there are specific
parts of the brain

787
01:35:37,901 --> 01:35:40,501
from which we can begin
to measure

788
01:35:40,501 --> 01:35:44,167
rapid electrical
firing patterns

789
01:35:44,167 --> 01:35:48,734
that show when an adept,
a really well trained meditator

790
01:35:48,734 --> 01:35:50,667
in this case--
but it could be a chess player,

791
01:35:50,667 --> 01:35:53,200
it could be a mathematician,
could be an engineer,

792
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:57,834
could be a therapist--
can invoke a state of mind

793
01:35:57,834 --> 01:36:00,701
that's open to loving-kindness
towards all beings.

794
01:36:00,701 --> 01:36:03,133
And how does that manifest
in these electrical patterns

795
01:36:03,133 --> 01:36:04,534
in the brain?

796
01:36:04,534 --> 01:36:06,534
Well, in fact, we can begin
to delineate that.

797
01:36:06,534 --> 01:36:08,234
Can we train it?

798
01:36:08,234 --> 01:36:10,367
And that brings the last part
of this talk.

799
01:36:10,367 --> 01:36:12,434
The most inspiring part,
I hope.

800
01:36:12,434 --> 01:36:14,601
Neuroplasticity.

801
01:36:14,601 --> 01:36:17,968
So until recently we thought,
You can't change the brain.

802
01:36:17,968 --> 01:36:19,567
You can't change the anatomy.

803
01:36:19,567 --> 01:36:24,133
You can't change the functioning
or the linking of circuitry.

804
01:36:24,133 --> 01:36:27,234
Well, in fact, we're finding
more and more that you can.

805
01:36:27,234 --> 01:36:29,234
So until recently they thought,
"Okay, so maybe

806
01:36:29,234 --> 01:36:31,434
"when you're infants,
the brain is plastic.

807
01:36:31,434 --> 01:36:34,834
But as you become adolescent
and adult, you cannot."

808
01:36:34,834 --> 01:36:37,100
That also now has been debunked.

809
01:36:37,100 --> 01:36:39,033
And in fact,
training the brain--

810
01:36:39,033 --> 01:36:42,667
Training influences brain
structure and brain function.

811
01:36:42,667 --> 01:36:44,000
Here we go.

812
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,734
This is a very, very simple
engineering diagram

813
01:36:46,734 --> 01:36:48,167
of the brain.

814
01:36:48,167 --> 01:36:49,400
Very simple.

815
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:52,100
The brain is super--
What is it?

816
01:36:52,100 --> 01:36:55,300
Google actually refers
to ten to the hundredth, right?

817
01:36:55,300 --> 01:36:58,334
That's what a google is.
I looked it up.

818
01:36:58,334 --> 01:37:00,300
I would posit that the brain
is that complex.

819
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:04,100
We are only presenting
reduced reductionistic

820
01:37:04,100 --> 01:37:05,367
aspects of the brain.

821
01:37:05,367 --> 01:37:06,834
The brain is much more complex

822
01:37:06,834 --> 01:37:09,834
and beautiful
than we can imagine.

823
01:37:09,834 --> 01:37:12,601
But we know from
our own experience,

824
01:37:12,601 --> 01:37:15,801
and I hope this is true,
that in our own mental states

825
01:37:15,801 --> 01:37:21,734
can be like a fly stuck
on sundew leaves.

826
01:37:21,734 --> 01:37:24,667
Stuck, not able to fly.

827
01:37:24,667 --> 01:37:26,868
And at other times,
via our own experience,

828
01:37:26,868 --> 01:37:30,667
we can experience our own mind
as a fluid mountain stream.

829
01:37:30,667 --> 01:37:33,734
And I would posit
that it's about our choice.

830
01:37:33,734 --> 01:37:37,100
We can train the mind
in either of these directions.

831
01:37:37,100 --> 01:37:39,033
We can also bring a sense
of acceptance

832
01:37:39,033 --> 01:37:43,534
to both of these mental states
in our self and others.

833
01:37:43,534 --> 01:37:46,901
So what's the evidence
from neuroscience?

834
01:37:46,901 --> 01:37:50,100
Well, for people who have
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,

835
01:37:50,100 --> 01:37:53,601
a study now ten years ago--
a decade ago--

836
01:37:53,601 --> 01:37:55,901
looked at
the orbital frontal cortex

837
01:37:55,901 --> 01:37:59,501
right up behind the eyes
and actually found

838
01:37:59,501 --> 01:38:03,767
that a part of the baseline
you could actually predict

839
01:38:03,767 --> 01:38:07,634
based on your metabolism
of glucose

840
01:38:07,634 --> 01:38:10,601
in that part
of the orbital frontal cortex.

841
01:38:10,601 --> 01:38:13,767
Predicted who would respond
to both medications

842
01:38:13,767 --> 01:38:16,267
and to behavioral therapy.

843
01:38:16,267 --> 01:38:18,734
This was a very important study.

844
01:38:18,734 --> 01:38:20,501
A groundbreaking study
that could show

845
01:38:20,501 --> 01:38:24,234
brain functioning can predict
who will benefit from at least

846
01:38:24,234 --> 01:38:27,434
two very different forms
of clinical treatment

847
01:38:27,434 --> 01:38:29,868
in people with
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.

848
01:38:29,868 --> 01:38:31,334
Very exciting.

849
01:38:31,334 --> 01:38:33,567
Fast forward.

850
01:38:33,567 --> 01:38:35,567
Now three years ago,
Chris deCharms,

851
01:38:35,567 --> 01:38:39,334
formerly at Stanford,
did a fantastic study

852
01:38:39,334 --> 01:38:41,601
looking at--
showing people

853
01:38:41,601 --> 01:38:45,434
in the MRI scanner a little
igloo with a fire.

854
01:38:45,434 --> 01:38:48,701
The greater the fire,
the greater the neural activity

855
01:38:48,701 --> 01:38:51,133
in a specific
part of the brain.

856
01:38:51,133 --> 01:38:52,901
This part of the brain.

857
01:38:52,901 --> 01:38:55,367
And he had people
up and down regulate

858
01:38:55,367 --> 01:38:59,801
from moment to moment
their own brain activity.

859
01:38:59,801 --> 01:39:03,000
And it was represented by
the flame inside of an igloo

860
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:07,501
for people with chronic
physical, emotional pain,

861
01:39:07,501 --> 01:39:09,300
and show them
that they could actually

862
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:12,701
up and down regulate activity
in a specific part of the brain.

863
01:39:12,701 --> 01:39:15,834
That's neuroplasticity
in a clinical intervention

864
01:39:15,834 --> 01:39:19,167
for people with chronic pain
using what's called

865
01:39:19,167 --> 01:39:21,834
real-time fMRI.

866
01:39:21,834 --> 01:39:23,834
This is one
of my favorite studies.

867
01:39:23,834 --> 01:39:28,200
London cabbie drivers.
Cab drivers.

868
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:34,167
Showing that the number of years
of experience driving

869
01:39:34,167 --> 01:39:37,934
in London, which apparently
is an incredibly complex grid,

870
01:39:37,934 --> 01:39:41,534
not like New York City,
that they actually had

871
01:39:41,534 --> 01:39:45,434
greater activity
in the hippocampus.

872
01:39:45,434 --> 01:39:46,601
On a struc--I'm sorry.

873
01:39:46,601 --> 01:39:48,167
Structural changes
in the structure

874
01:39:48,167 --> 01:39:50,667
of the hippocampus based
on the numbers of years

875
01:39:50,667 --> 01:39:53,267
of experience
driving a cab in London.

876
01:39:53,267 --> 01:39:56,534
Direct experience literally
changing the shape

877
01:39:56,534 --> 01:39:57,934
of the anatomy of the brain.

878
01:39:57,934 --> 01:40:00,067
Again, neuroplasticity.

879
01:40:00,067 --> 01:40:01,501
These are examples.

880
01:40:01,501 --> 01:40:05,367
Specific phobia showing that
cognitive-behavioral therapy,

881
01:40:05,367 --> 01:40:07,267
which is the gold standard
psychotherapy

882
01:40:07,267 --> 01:40:09,801
for most of the anx--actually,
all the anxiety disorders

883
01:40:09,801 --> 01:40:12,601
and this specific phobia
being one kind.

884
01:40:12,601 --> 01:40:16,367
Showing that from pre to post
cognitive-behavioral therapy,

885
01:40:16,367 --> 01:40:19,334
activity in the--whoops.

886
01:40:19,334 --> 01:40:22,334
Here shown
in the anterior cingulate

887
01:40:22,334 --> 01:40:26,234
and also in bilateral insula
was reduced

888
01:40:26,234 --> 01:40:28,334
following
cognitive-behavioral therapy.

889
01:40:28,334 --> 01:40:31,434
So people's cognitive conflict,
cogni--

890
01:40:31,434 --> 01:40:33,701
And also their visceral
emotional reactivity

891
01:40:33,701 --> 01:40:36,667
reduced in the presence
of the phobic stimulus

892
01:40:36,667 --> 01:40:40,801
from pre to post
cognitive-behavioral therapy.

893
01:40:40,801 --> 01:40:44,133
Here's just another study about
actually what we're doing.

894
01:40:44,133 --> 01:40:46,100
This is preliminary evidence
showing that for people

895
01:40:46,100 --> 01:40:48,100
with social anxiety disorder,
when working

896
01:40:48,100 --> 01:40:50,467
with your own negative
self-beliefs,

897
01:40:50,467 --> 01:40:53,567
pre-post 16 sessions
of cognitive-behavioral therapy

898
01:40:53,567 --> 01:40:55,734
for social anxiety.

899
01:40:55,734 --> 01:40:58,033
Red here means increased
activity in areas

900
01:40:58,033 --> 01:41:00,267
having to do
with self-regulation,

901
01:41:00,267 --> 01:41:03,634
access to linguistic processing,

902
01:41:03,634 --> 01:41:06,100
and then attention
and cognitive regulation.

903
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:07,968
Increases in people
when they're working

904
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:12,467
with their own negative beliefs
pre to post cognitive therapy.

905
01:41:12,467 --> 01:41:15,267
This is a very interesting study
that was done cross-sectionally.

906
01:41:15,267 --> 01:41:16,667
Not pre-post, but looking

907
01:41:16,667 --> 01:41:19,133
at insight meditation
practitioners.

908
01:41:19,133 --> 01:41:22,033
That on an anatomical level,
these two areas,

909
01:41:22,033 --> 01:41:24,701
which normally decline
as you age--

910
01:41:24,701 --> 01:41:27,100
This is gray matter.

911
01:41:27,100 --> 01:41:30,467
Normally decline as you age,
which actually was preserved

912
01:41:30,467 --> 01:41:32,734
in those people who meditated.

913
01:41:32,734 --> 01:41:35,033
And in fact, the number
of years of meditation

914
01:41:35,033 --> 01:41:39,334
was shown to protect--
was a protective mechanism--

915
01:41:39,334 --> 01:41:42,400
against the normal decay or loss
or degeneration

916
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:44,167
of gray matter.

917
01:41:44,167 --> 01:41:46,200
Cross-sectional study.
Not pre-post.

918
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:47,934
So it's a different
kind of design.

919
01:41:47,934 --> 01:41:49,400
But I'm sure that somebody
will be working

920
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:51,767
on stronger
experimental designs soon.

921
01:41:51,767 --> 01:41:54,834
So again, more evidence
that how what we choose to do

922
01:41:54,834 --> 01:41:57,534
with our time influences
even across

923
01:41:57,534 --> 01:42:01,934
the aging process.

924
01:42:01,934 --> 01:42:03,601
And this is just
another study showing

925
01:42:03,601 --> 01:42:04,767
that with mindfulness meditation

926
01:42:04,767 --> 01:42:07,601
in people
with anxiety disorders--

927
01:42:07,601 --> 01:42:09,968
In these circles is a network
of brain regions

928
01:42:09,968 --> 01:42:13,133
in which attention regulation
is instantiated

929
01:42:13,133 --> 01:42:15,400
and that those regions
are increased--

930
01:42:15,400 --> 01:42:19,734
I.E., better ability to use the
brain to shift your attention

931
01:42:19,734 --> 01:42:24,567
pre-post mindfulness training.

932
01:42:24,567 --> 01:42:27,434
And even before,
I said about the self.

933
01:42:27,434 --> 01:42:30,000
We also have preliminary
evidence

934
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,167
that's now in at least two
different labs

935
01:42:32,167 --> 01:42:33,734
or three different
labs for people

936
01:42:33,734 --> 01:42:36,400
with anxiety disorders
or even depression,

937
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:40,767
that the neural network that
supports cell-focused attention

938
01:42:40,767 --> 01:42:44,834
can actually be modulated
with attention training.

939
01:42:44,834 --> 01:42:47,033
Mindfulness
meditation training.

940
01:42:47,033 --> 01:42:52,300
So in summary--
Threat, real or imagined?

941
01:42:52,300 --> 01:42:56,567
Definitely we can see is that
you can modulate up or down--

942
01:42:56,567 --> 01:42:58,367
but hopefully down--

943
01:42:58,367 --> 01:43:00,634
the intensity
of emotional reactivity.

944
01:43:00,634 --> 01:43:03,501
And that you can use all
of these other brain systems.

945
01:43:03,501 --> 01:43:07,334
Cognitive regulation, thinking,
attention regulation.

946
01:43:07,334 --> 01:43:10,334
They're eventually shifting our
awareness and our attention

947
01:43:10,334 --> 01:43:13,067
mediated through
self-view and language

948
01:43:13,067 --> 01:43:17,267
to lead
to greater well-being.

949
01:43:17,267 --> 01:43:20,534
I have done this work with many,
many other people.

950
01:43:20,534 --> 01:43:22,133
These people are in my group.

951
01:43:22,133 --> 01:43:24,667
And many others who aren't
even in the picture here.

952
01:43:24,667 --> 01:43:28,167
And this is where
I am virtually.

953
01:43:28,167 --> 01:43:30,234
I'm actually right here.

954
01:43:30,234 --> 01:43:32,634
And thank you
for your attention.

955
01:43:32,634 --> 01:43:38,434
[applause]

956
01:43:38,434 --> 01:43:40,501
Ming: We have about
ten minutes for questions...

957
01:43:40,501 --> 01:43:43,367
and answers.

958
01:43:43,367 --> 01:43:45,100
Goldin: Maybe only
questions?

959
01:43:45,100 --> 01:43:48,968
Ming: Any questions?

960
01:43:48,968 --> 01:43:50,334
Goldin: Are any of you
pondering?

961
01:43:50,334 --> 01:43:51,667
It doesn't even have
to be a question.

962
01:43:51,667 --> 01:43:54,300
A reflection.

963
01:43:54,300 --> 01:43:57,334
man: Sorry, just wondering will
these slides be posted?

964
01:43:57,334 --> 01:43:59,200
Will we have access to these?

965
01:43:59,200 --> 01:44:02,334
Goldin: The whole talk is going
to be uploaded to YouTube

966
01:44:02,334 --> 01:44:04,834
in its entirety.

967
01:44:04,834 --> 01:44:06,300
man: Okay, thank you.

968
01:44:06,300 --> 01:44:10,834
Goldin: So you can
ponder it even more.

969
01:44:10,834 --> 01:44:12,267
woman: Would you be able
to go back

970
01:44:12,267 --> 01:44:14,267
to the study
on the adolescents and--

971
01:44:14,267 --> 01:44:15,868
Goldin: Yes.

972
01:44:15,868 --> 01:44:18,334
woman: Just go--
I wasn't sure.

973
01:44:18,334 --> 01:44:20,234
What?
[man speaking indistinctly]

974
01:44:20,234 --> 01:44:24,367
No, grown up.

975
01:44:24,367 --> 01:44:26,634
'Cause it seemed like you were
saying something

976
01:44:26,634 --> 01:44:30,801
that to me seemed contradictory
but maybe it was just--

977
01:44:30,801 --> 01:44:32,133
I was misunderstanding.

978
01:44:32,133 --> 01:44:34,567
Goldin: Okay, so here--
this is one study.

979
01:44:34,567 --> 01:44:35,767
One thing I wanna
make very clear

980
01:44:35,767 --> 01:44:37,467
is don't trust one study.

981
01:44:37,467 --> 01:44:41,634
Trust the meta analyses
or trust a study

982
01:44:41,634 --> 01:44:43,167
that's been replicated
at least once,

983
01:44:43,167 --> 01:44:45,267
preferably twice,
not in the same lab.

984
01:44:45,267 --> 01:44:47,467
That's one thing that's
a caveat in science.

985
01:44:47,467 --> 01:44:49,033
Don't trust any one study.

986
01:44:49,033 --> 01:44:50,834
Here, this is one study

987
01:44:50,834 --> 01:44:53,167
with 16 children
and adolescents.

988
01:44:53,167 --> 01:44:55,400
So already that's
kind of a wide range.

989
01:44:55,400 --> 01:44:58,234
But supposedly what
we've presented in the study

990
01:44:58,234 --> 01:44:59,567
is that the greater--

991
01:44:59,567 --> 01:45:01,467
by self-report
on a questionnaire--

992
01:45:01,467 --> 01:45:05,000
The greater
the emotional intelligence score

993
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:09,334
reported by kids
and adolescents,

994
01:45:09,334 --> 01:45:14,133
the reduction--blue--
in these regions

995
01:45:14,133 --> 01:45:19,033
and other regions that have
to do with emotional reactivity,

996
01:45:19,033 --> 01:45:25,033
visceral response
to fear faces.

997
01:45:25,033 --> 01:45:26,901
woman: Specifically
to fear faces?

998
01:45:26,901 --> 01:45:28,734
Goldin: Yeah, this is
just one example.

999
01:45:28,734 --> 01:45:32,033
This is
to fear facial expressions.

1000
01:45:32,033 --> 01:45:34,367
And people--

1001
01:45:34,367 --> 01:45:38,367
The human brain
is super sensitive

1002
01:45:38,367 --> 01:45:42,067
to facial expressions
of fear, anger,

1003
01:45:42,067 --> 01:45:44,734
and have a reliable
neural response.

1004
01:45:44,734 --> 01:45:46,167
woman: Okay, thanks.

1005
01:45:46,167 --> 01:45:47,801
Goldin: But it is interesting.

1006
01:45:47,801 --> 01:45:49,167
What exactly--

1007
01:45:49,167 --> 01:45:51,133
So this is a very
kind of course.

1008
01:45:51,133 --> 01:45:52,934
What aspect
of emotional intelligence

1009
01:45:52,934 --> 01:45:56,434
relates to less emotional
reactivity to fear?

1010
01:45:56,434 --> 01:45:57,501
That was not answered.

1011
01:45:57,501 --> 01:45:58,767
woman: Right.

1012
01:45:58,767 --> 01:46:00,334
Goldin: That's why you need
further studies.

1013
01:46:00,334 --> 01:46:02,567
Is that only in the adolescents
or is it in younger kids?

1014
01:46:02,567 --> 01:46:04,133
Is it age dependant?

1015
01:46:04,133 --> 01:46:05,601
In fact, another study
that I don't think

1016
01:46:05,601 --> 01:46:08,501
is published yet from our group,
James Gross's lab

1017
01:46:08,501 --> 01:46:10,234
at Stanford Psychophysiology
Laboratory,

1018
01:46:10,234 --> 01:46:13,234
looking at the eight-year olds
up to 22-year olds--

1019
01:46:13,234 --> 01:46:15,501
boys and girls,
every single age--

1020
01:46:15,501 --> 01:46:19,133
the ability to use thinking,
re-interpretation strategies,

1021
01:46:19,133 --> 01:46:22,601
i.e. cognitive regulation or
cognitive reappraisal--

1022
01:46:22,601 --> 01:46:24,534
in clinical, we say
cognitive restructuring--

1023
01:46:24,534 --> 01:46:27,100
to emotional probe,
to emotional reactivity,

1024
01:46:27,100 --> 01:46:29,801
was actually predicted
by cognitive development.

1025
01:46:29,801 --> 01:46:31,133
Which totally makes sense.

1026
01:46:31,133 --> 01:46:35,267
So the older you are,
the more cognitively developed.

1027
01:46:35,267 --> 01:46:37,534
The more cognitive development
you demonstrate

1028
01:46:37,534 --> 01:46:39,767
on neuropsychological tests,
the more you're able

1029
01:46:39,767 --> 01:46:42,400
to use cognitive reappraisal
strategies

1030
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:44,934
to down regulate
emotional reactivity.

1031
01:46:44,934 --> 01:46:48,334
So there is an age-dependent
thing from at least 8 to 22.

1032
01:46:48,334 --> 01:46:49,601
But then it raises the question,

1033
01:46:49,601 --> 01:46:51,834
"From 22 onwards--70, 80, 90--

1034
01:46:51,834 --> 01:46:53,467
what are we doing?"

1035
01:46:53,467 --> 01:46:55,934
Can we train?
Can we overcome anger?

1036
01:46:55,934 --> 01:46:57,868
Can we overcome low self-esteem?

1037
01:46:57,868 --> 01:47:00,634
Can we overcome insecurity?

1038
01:47:00,634 --> 01:47:02,901
And how?
And what are the best methods?

1039
01:47:02,901 --> 01:47:04,901
Yeah, so I think there's
somebody behind you.

1040
01:47:04,901 --> 01:47:06,567
man: S.I.Y.

1041
01:47:06,567 --> 01:47:08,601
Goldin: S.I.Y.
Search Inside Yourself.

1042
01:47:08,601 --> 01:47:11,067
One method to do that
or at least to begin

1043
01:47:11,067 --> 01:47:12,667
to try to do that.

1044
01:47:12,667 --> 01:47:14,567
man: I'm just wondering
if there's any consensus

1045
01:47:14,567 --> 01:47:17,934
among the critics or skepticism
around this work

1046
01:47:17,934 --> 01:47:19,567
that might be--

1047
01:47:19,567 --> 01:47:23,067
that we might be able
to address as well?

1048
01:47:23,067 --> 01:47:24,734
Goldin: Um, does any--

1049
01:47:24,734 --> 01:47:26,534
I mean,
I have my own skepticism.

1050
01:47:26,534 --> 01:47:27,834
Are you--

1051
01:47:27,834 --> 01:47:28,868
Is there something
in your mind that's come up?

1052
01:47:28,868 --> 01:47:30,200
man: No, no, no, I don't.

1053
01:47:30,200 --> 01:47:32,334
In fact, this is all very new
and very exciting.

1054
01:47:32,334 --> 01:47:33,934
Goldin: Yeah, sure.

1055
01:47:33,934 --> 01:47:35,400
I'm happy to--

1056
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:36,934
You know, one of the great
things about being in science

1057
01:47:36,934 --> 01:47:40,334
is that we can be skeptical
professionally.

1058
01:47:40,334 --> 01:47:42,901
So I have my skepticism
in the following way.

1059
01:47:42,901 --> 01:47:45,567
I'll try to just briefly--

1060
01:47:45,567 --> 01:47:48,334
So for example,
in cognitive-behavorial therapy,

1061
01:47:48,334 --> 01:47:51,434
which I'm trained in,
it's change oriented.

1062
01:47:51,434 --> 01:47:53,434
Identifying mistakes
in thinking.

1063
01:47:53,434 --> 01:47:55,868
Thinking in ways that
are actually harmful,

1064
01:47:55,868 --> 01:47:59,667
not beneficial, that lead
to feeling worse about myself

1065
01:47:59,667 --> 01:48:01,100
or others.

1066
01:48:01,100 --> 01:48:03,067
One method to work
with that is to identify

1067
01:48:03,067 --> 01:48:06,067
those thoughts, modify them,
change them,

1068
01:48:06,067 --> 01:48:09,667
deconstruct them, find
evidence that those thoughts

1069
01:48:09,667 --> 01:48:13,434
are either not accurate or that
they're not beneficial.

1070
01:48:13,434 --> 01:48:15,868
So that's really a heady,
logical, linguistic,

1071
01:48:15,868 --> 01:48:18,434
language approach.

1072
01:48:18,434 --> 01:48:20,200
Shift.

1073
01:48:20,200 --> 01:48:22,167
I'm also trained in mindfulness
or in meditation.

1074
01:48:22,167 --> 01:48:23,634
Different kinds
of meditation techniques.

1075
01:48:23,634 --> 01:48:25,567
One of which is mindfulness
meditation.

1076
01:48:25,567 --> 01:48:29,968
There, you go for change,
but it's not language based,

1077
01:48:29,968 --> 01:48:33,000
it's not linguistic,
it's not cognitively

1078
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:34,534
challenging my thoughts.

1079
01:48:34,534 --> 01:48:40,467
It's actually shifting how
I approach my own experience.

1080
01:48:40,467 --> 01:48:44,367
Radically different from the
cognitive-behavioral approach.

1081
01:48:44,367 --> 01:48:48,067
But probably leading
to the same kind

1082
01:48:48,067 --> 01:48:51,501
of psychological flexibility.

1083
01:48:51,501 --> 01:48:53,567
Currently people are--

1084
01:48:53,567 --> 01:48:55,601
How do we know when someone
walks in the door

1085
01:48:55,601 --> 01:48:58,601
or even a friend,
what methods work best for whom?

1086
01:48:58,601 --> 01:49:00,267
We actually don't know that.

1087
01:49:00,267 --> 01:49:03,868
How do know that
a combined approach

1088
01:49:03,868 --> 01:49:07,167
would work best
for Joe or for Sally?

1089
01:49:07,167 --> 01:49:08,834
Currently, we actually
don't know.

1090
01:49:08,834 --> 01:49:10,400
And this is one
of the biggest problems.

1091
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:12,934
If I train you
in certain skills

1092
01:49:12,934 --> 01:49:14,734
where I assume this
is gonna be helpful for you

1093
01:49:14,734 --> 01:49:16,834
when they're not,
we've just wasted energy,

1094
01:49:16,834 --> 01:49:21,267
time, money, even actually
inducing more frustration.

1095
01:49:21,267 --> 01:49:24,434
So for example, meditation
is not good for everybody.

1096
01:49:24,434 --> 01:49:26,000
We know that as a fact.

1097
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,100
Cognitive-behavioral therapy
doesn't treat

1098
01:49:28,100 --> 01:49:31,167
everyone's anxiety
or depression 100%.

1099
01:49:31,167 --> 01:49:32,834
We know that as well.

1100
01:49:32,834 --> 01:49:35,400
What's in the 30%
that don't get better?

1101
01:49:35,400 --> 01:49:39,033
How can we figure out
who will get better?

1102
01:49:39,033 --> 01:49:40,734
Yeah, yeah, okay.

1103
01:49:40,734 --> 01:49:42,400
I mean, I have many more
questions and doubts

1104
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:44,968
but that's at least
one of them I can share.

1105
01:49:44,968 --> 01:49:49,467
Yeah.

1106
01:49:49,467 --> 01:49:52,667
woman: You just listed off two
different types of treatment.

1107
01:49:52,667 --> 01:49:55,367
Besides meditation, what are
some other tools that you use?

1108
01:49:55,367 --> 01:49:57,367
I mean, like, can you kinda give
us, like, a case study

1109
01:49:57,367 --> 01:49:58,701
or some examples?

1110
01:49:58,701 --> 01:50:01,267
If I was to walk in your door,
what would we do?

1111
01:50:01,267 --> 01:50:02,567
Goldin: Sure.
How about exercise?

1112
01:50:02,567 --> 01:50:03,934
woman: No.

1113
01:50:03,934 --> 01:50:06,100
Goldin: Exercise
is a powerful mood regulator.

1114
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:08,634
But one of the things
that happens there--

1115
01:50:08,634 --> 01:50:10,133
'Cause we're actually
doing a study right now.

1116
01:50:10,133 --> 01:50:12,601
Brain imaging pre-post exercise

1117
01:50:12,601 --> 01:50:15,834
for two and a half months
for people with anxiety.

1118
01:50:15,834 --> 01:50:19,334
That may or may not
be just as effective

1119
01:50:19,334 --> 01:50:21,000
as mindfulness meditation

1120
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:22,400
or even cognitive-behavioral
therapy.

1121
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:24,901
But it might be
very different mechanisms.

1122
01:50:24,901 --> 01:50:26,133
So that's something.

1123
01:50:26,133 --> 01:50:27,968
A whole other thing
that we're not studying

1124
01:50:27,968 --> 01:50:29,968
that could be very powerful
to study

1125
01:50:29,968 --> 01:50:32,934
since we are so embedded
in logos or language

1126
01:50:32,934 --> 01:50:34,968
is communication skills.

1127
01:50:34,968 --> 01:50:37,300
How we actually
process language.

1128
01:50:37,300 --> 01:50:41,501
Even training ourselves
to use language

1129
01:50:41,501 --> 01:50:44,834
and linguistic processing
in a way that's less harmful

1130
01:50:44,834 --> 01:50:46,834
to self and others.

1131
01:50:46,834 --> 01:50:48,767
That would be
a whole other method

1132
01:50:48,767 --> 01:50:50,067
that's not about therapy.

1133
01:50:50,067 --> 01:50:52,801
It's not about meditation.

1134
01:50:52,801 --> 01:50:55,367
Those are at least two examples
that come to mind.

1135
01:50:55,367 --> 01:50:57,334
And even, like,
we talked about mindfulness.

1136
01:50:57,334 --> 01:50:59,601
Here's a whole other realm
with just compassion.

1137
01:50:59,601 --> 01:51:02,367
So, for example,
here's a thought.

1138
01:51:02,367 --> 01:51:05,100
You take somebody who has an
eating disorder,

1139
01:51:05,100 --> 01:51:10,367
be it bulimia or binging
or whatever or anorexia.

1140
01:51:10,367 --> 01:51:15,267
Could you actually train the
person to view themselves

1141
01:51:15,267 --> 01:51:19,367
via compassion meditation
on the self and others

1142
01:51:19,367 --> 01:51:22,834
to actually move around
the distorted self-view

1143
01:51:22,834 --> 01:51:25,934
that leads
to constriction of food

1144
01:51:25,934 --> 01:51:29,400
or dissolving into food
or vomiting, et cetera?

1145
01:51:29,400 --> 01:51:32,601
I'm not sure that's been studied
but there are approaches.

1146
01:51:32,601 --> 01:51:34,801
So, for example,
I think we have

1147
01:51:34,801 --> 01:51:38,100
to think outside the box
right now.

1148
01:51:38,100 --> 01:51:40,133
Google is a thinking company.

1149
01:51:40,133 --> 01:51:42,567
And that's exactly
what we need to do as well

1150
01:51:42,567 --> 01:51:44,701
instead of just staying
with our normal, you know,

1151
01:51:44,701 --> 01:51:46,234
psychotherapies,
our trainings.

1152
01:51:46,234 --> 01:51:48,267
There may be other ways
to work with the mind

1153
01:51:48,267 --> 01:51:50,968
that could be more powerful
that we just haven't tried yet

1154
01:51:50,968 --> 01:51:52,234
or thought about.

1155
01:51:52,234 --> 01:51:53,968
Just to be clear,
mindfulness meditation

1156
01:51:53,968 --> 01:51:55,367
is one type of meditation.

1157
01:51:55,367 --> 01:51:57,067
There are many, many,
many kinds of meditation,

1158
01:51:57,067 --> 01:51:58,534
for example.

1159
01:51:58,534 --> 01:52:00,000
Many of which haven't even
been translated

1160
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,834
or incorporated
into Western psychotherapy yet.

1161
01:52:02,834 --> 01:52:06,067
Zen has in the dialectic
behavioral therapy,

1162
01:52:06,067 --> 01:52:08,100
mindfulness-based
cognitive therapy, et cetera.

1163
01:52:08,100 --> 01:52:10,000
But there are
many other techniques.

1164
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:11,868
Yeah.

1165
01:52:11,868 --> 01:52:14,767
That are waiting
to be tried out.

1166
01:52:14,767 --> 01:52:18,334
man: So it's my experience
and I also read

1167
01:52:18,334 --> 01:52:21,367
that basically if you take
any kind of action

1168
01:52:21,367 --> 01:52:24,767
or just express the emotion
then it basically becomes less.

1169
01:52:24,767 --> 01:52:27,133
Has there been any study
on that aspect

1170
01:52:27,133 --> 01:52:29,000
or did you touch that?

1171
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:30,734
Goldin: Did you say just
expressing the emotion?

1172
01:52:30,734 --> 01:52:33,701
man: Expressing or just any
other kind of action,

1173
01:52:33,701 --> 01:52:37,234
body motion, rather than just
keeping it within?

1174
01:52:37,234 --> 01:52:38,534
Basically, obviously,
it has an effect on you.

1175
01:52:38,534 --> 01:52:40,100
Goldin: Yeah, in general.
Yes.

1176
01:52:40,100 --> 01:52:43,000
Actually there's a very elegant
study by David Creswell.

1177
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,767
He was at UCLA and now he's
at Carnegie Mellon.

1178
01:52:45,767 --> 01:52:48,033
Where he just had people doing
emotional labeling

1179
01:52:48,033 --> 01:52:50,601
using language
in an MRI scanner

1180
01:52:50,601 --> 01:52:54,567
and found that just the act
of applying a word,

1181
01:52:54,567 --> 01:52:57,234
or a label, or a phrase
to describe the emotion

1182
01:52:57,234 --> 01:52:58,968
that one is feeling
in the moment

1183
01:52:58,968 --> 01:53:01,100
helps to reduce
Amagdyla reactivity.

1184
01:53:01,100 --> 01:53:03,734
Helps to actually shift neural
activity in the brain.

1185
01:53:03,734 --> 01:53:05,467
That's emotion labeling.

1186
01:53:05,467 --> 01:53:08,734
Motion expression,
catharsis,

1187
01:53:08,734 --> 01:53:10,567
in many cases can be helpful.

1188
01:53:10,567 --> 01:53:12,567
But we also know
that it has to be done

1189
01:53:12,567 --> 01:53:14,934
in a very skillful manner.

1190
01:53:14,934 --> 01:53:17,300
So, for example,
exposure therapy

1191
01:53:17,300 --> 01:53:20,434
has to do with exposing
one's self to what I fear

1192
01:53:20,434 --> 01:53:23,033
and addressing it.

1193
01:53:23,033 --> 01:53:24,734
So, for example,
exposure therapy

1194
01:53:24,734 --> 01:53:26,901
for post-traumatic
stress disorder

1195
01:53:26,901 --> 01:53:31,033
can either be very effective
if done well, repeatedly,

1196
01:53:31,033 --> 01:53:33,734
in a very concrete fashion,

1197
01:53:33,734 --> 01:53:36,100
but it can also
totally backfire.

1198
01:53:36,100 --> 01:53:40,133
And you can see people actually
melting down emotionally

1199
01:53:40,133 --> 01:53:42,601
when they're trying to express
and relive an emotion.

1200
01:53:42,601 --> 01:53:47,934
So it's more situation and
context and person dependent.

1201
01:53:47,934 --> 01:53:50,367
So no blanket thing
that catharsis

1202
01:53:50,367 --> 01:53:53,234
or emotional expression
is always helpful.

1203
01:53:53,234 --> 01:53:55,901
The other issue here is how is
it affecting the other people?

1204
01:53:55,901 --> 01:53:57,601
Maybe it's beneficial for me.

1205
01:53:57,601 --> 01:53:59,667
But I also--
The people around me--

1206
01:53:59,667 --> 01:54:01,167
If I'm doing it
with a professional

1207
01:54:01,167 --> 01:54:03,701
versus a friend
or at work or whatever,

1208
01:54:03,701 --> 01:54:07,200
I have to recognize that it may
have different repercussions

1209
01:54:07,200 --> 01:54:09,067
depending on
which context I'm in.

1210
01:54:09,067 --> 01:54:11,000
Yeah.

1211
01:54:18,467 --> 01:54:20,467
man: Thank you.
This is wonderful to hear.

1212
01:54:20,467 --> 01:54:23,667
You've mentioned
a lot of great things.

1213
01:54:23,667 --> 01:54:28,868
I'm really curious about
the fact that neuroscience

1214
01:54:28,868 --> 01:54:33,434
is very excited
about compassion recently.

1215
01:54:33,434 --> 01:54:36,868
And it's wonderful when we hear
that sciences are validating

1216
01:54:36,868 --> 01:54:39,234
age-old wisdoms, so.

1217
01:54:39,234 --> 01:54:41,501
The idea of slowing down,
being more mindful,

1218
01:54:41,501 --> 01:54:45,434
being in the present,
good food, exercise, so.

1219
01:54:45,434 --> 01:54:46,434
Goldin: Good friends.

1220
01:54:46,434 --> 01:54:47,734
man: Good friends.

1221
01:54:47,734 --> 01:54:51,400
Good relationships.
All of that good loving, yeah.

1222
01:54:51,400 --> 01:54:54,501
I'm just curious
whether or not you have

1223
01:54:54,501 --> 01:54:57,467
a certain perspective on how
that fits into our society,

1224
01:54:57,467 --> 01:55:01,868
because those age-old wisdoms
are sound and true.

1225
01:55:01,868 --> 01:55:05,634
But in a society where we're
constantly fragmented,

1226
01:55:05,634 --> 01:55:09,133
or even the idea of memory,
it's being fragmented

1227
01:55:09,133 --> 01:55:11,267
even by the fact that we're
searching every day

1228
01:55:11,267 --> 01:55:13,033
and we don't bother
remembering things.

1229
01:55:13,033 --> 01:55:15,801
Memory's important
from an emotional context

1230
01:55:15,801 --> 01:55:18,300
for understanding who we are.

1231
01:55:18,300 --> 01:55:20,868
So, yes, we're understanding it.

1232
01:55:20,868 --> 01:55:22,534
Yes, we're validating it.

1233
01:55:22,534 --> 01:55:25,067
Do you have an opinion
on how we can integrate it

1234
01:55:25,067 --> 01:55:29,300
into our lives
and complimenting, perhaps,

1235
01:55:29,300 --> 01:55:35,234
our need to be fast-paced
and hungry and diverse?

1236
01:55:35,234 --> 01:55:37,234
Goldin: That's a great question.

1237
01:55:37,234 --> 01:55:41,000
And, um...

1238
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,234
Introducing silence
and stillness.

1239
01:55:43,234 --> 01:55:47,167
Appreciation
for silence and stillness.

1240
01:55:47,167 --> 01:55:49,734
Going into stillness
in one's self.

1241
01:55:49,734 --> 01:55:53,067
In little kids.
In families.

1242
01:55:53,067 --> 01:55:57,467
In fact, my favorite studies are
about training whole families

1243
01:55:57,467 --> 01:55:59,934
to become quiet.

1244
01:55:59,934 --> 01:56:04,968
To actually take stillness
as a family exercise.

1245
01:56:04,968 --> 01:56:08,701
Can you imagine taking stillness
as a work exercise?

1246
01:56:08,701 --> 01:56:11,334
So, for example,
our lab meetings.

1247
01:56:11,334 --> 01:56:14,834
My little group,
we begin in silence.

1248
01:56:14,834 --> 01:56:16,501
The Quakers do it.

1249
01:56:16,501 --> 01:56:21,033
Introducing silence
both mentally and communally.

1250
01:56:21,033 --> 01:56:24,000
As a practice,
that's not bizarre or weird.

1251
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:27,834
That actually reinforces how
people feel about each other.

1252
01:56:27,834 --> 01:56:29,901
But the key thing you're saying
is right.

1253
01:56:29,901 --> 01:56:32,100
How do we integrate this both
intrapersonally--

1254
01:56:32,100 --> 01:56:33,601
Like, in me?

1255
01:56:33,601 --> 01:56:35,467
And that's something that
each person has to figure out.

1256
01:56:35,467 --> 01:56:38,133
How do I find that still,
quiet place inside?

1257
01:56:38,133 --> 01:56:40,200
Nourish it.
Enjoy it.

1258
01:56:40,200 --> 01:56:42,267
Actually, like, enjoy it.

1259
01:56:42,267 --> 01:56:45,133
How do I experience that
with other people?

1260
01:56:45,133 --> 01:56:48,501
So in psychotherapy,
this sensibility

1261
01:56:48,501 --> 01:56:50,067
has kinda been infused lately.

1262
01:56:50,067 --> 01:56:51,968
Mindfulness, acceptance,
et cetera.

1263
01:56:51,968 --> 01:56:54,467
And people are experimenting
both in individual,

1264
01:56:54,467 --> 01:56:55,968
couples, group therapy.

1265
01:56:55,968 --> 01:56:58,901
In workplaces,
people are recognizing

1266
01:56:58,901 --> 01:57:04,067
that well-being
is as monetarily valuable

1267
01:57:04,067 --> 01:57:08,234
to creativity,
to lack of illness,

1268
01:57:08,234 --> 01:57:10,334
to a communal sense,

1269
01:57:10,334 --> 01:57:12,400
and even, for example,
creativity.

1270
01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:14,234
So if the mind--

1271
01:57:14,234 --> 01:57:16,567
If you're a company
that really requires

1272
01:57:16,567 --> 01:57:18,734
thinking outside the box,

1273
01:57:18,734 --> 01:57:20,901
and you know there's different
forms of stress

1274
01:57:20,901 --> 01:57:23,167
that make me box-like--

1275
01:57:23,167 --> 01:57:26,133
Wow, gosh,
I have to address that.

1276
01:57:26,133 --> 01:57:31,234
And actively creating community,
be it on a family level,

1277
01:57:31,234 --> 01:57:33,667
be it amongst people here,
be it even, like,

1278
01:57:33,667 --> 01:57:35,167
a little work team.

1279
01:57:35,167 --> 01:57:37,067
I don't know
what vocabulary you use.

1280
01:57:37,067 --> 01:57:40,634
But introducing that sensibility
either just as a tool

1281
01:57:40,634 --> 01:57:44,167
for people to become
more still, creative, aware.

1282
01:57:44,167 --> 01:57:49,100
Even pausing for a moment
before responding.

1283
01:57:50,734 --> 01:57:52,467
And then again,
it's all of this--

1284
01:57:52,467 --> 01:57:53,801
You know, there's the muscle
of attention

1285
01:57:53,801 --> 01:57:55,367
and anyone can develop that.

1286
01:57:55,367 --> 01:57:56,734
And then there's becoming--

1287
01:57:56,734 --> 01:57:59,901
Search inside yourself
to become more and more aware.

1288
01:57:59,901 --> 01:58:01,734
How does my mind work?

1289
01:58:01,734 --> 01:58:04,133
How does my mind work?
Being curious.

1290
01:58:04,133 --> 01:58:06,634
How do I impact others?

1291
01:58:06,634 --> 01:58:09,434
How do I understand
when I feel off

1292
01:58:09,434 --> 01:58:11,067
or emotionally off-balance?

1293
01:58:11,067 --> 01:58:12,701
How can I bring myself back?

1294
01:58:12,701 --> 01:58:15,067
How can I become more skillful
with myself?

1295
01:58:15,067 --> 01:58:17,100
You know, other people
take care of themselves.

1296
01:58:17,100 --> 01:58:18,467
But just myself.

1297
01:58:18,467 --> 01:58:20,467
So I think it starts
from an individual practice

1298
01:58:20,467 --> 01:58:25,400
and then it will automatically
touch other people.

1299
01:58:25,400 --> 01:58:27,100
So just a simple example,
you know?

1300
01:58:27,100 --> 01:58:29,400
Paul Ekman,
who spoke yesterday on NPR

1301
01:58:29,400 --> 01:58:30,767
and who's, uh--

1302
01:58:30,767 --> 01:58:33,434
He was a pretty intense--

1303
01:58:33,434 --> 01:58:36,200
intense, difficult,
researcher guy.

1304
01:58:36,200 --> 01:58:38,767
He went to India
specifically 'cause

1305
01:58:38,767 --> 01:58:40,934
his daughter wanted
to meet the Dalai Lama.

1306
01:58:40,934 --> 01:58:42,634
I don't think Paul Ekman
was interested.

1307
01:58:42,634 --> 01:58:44,734
He went there
and he was smitten.

1308
01:58:44,734 --> 01:58:46,100
That's the right word.

1309
01:58:46,100 --> 01:58:48,734
Touched, smitten...

1310
01:58:48,734 --> 01:58:51,734
by something inexplicable and so
much so that he said

1311
01:58:51,734 --> 01:58:54,801
yesterday on the radio
that when he saw his wife,

1312
01:58:54,801 --> 01:58:56,868
who did not attend this meeting,

1313
01:58:56,868 --> 01:58:59,467
she said, "You're not
the husband I knew

1314
01:58:59,467 --> 01:59:01,501
for the past several decades."

1315
01:59:01,501 --> 01:59:03,968
He'd been touched by something
and he's still trying

1316
01:59:03,968 --> 01:59:05,501
to figure out what that is.

1317
01:59:05,501 --> 01:59:07,701
So there's also this sense
of contagion.

1318
01:59:07,701 --> 01:59:10,033
So emotional contagion
can either drive us nuts,

1319
01:59:10,033 --> 01:59:13,667
'cause somebody else is,
you know, totally off-balance

1320
01:59:13,667 --> 01:59:14,968
and is making me off-balance.

1321
01:59:14,968 --> 01:59:17,100
That's the negative side
of contagion.

1322
01:59:17,100 --> 01:59:20,334
The other part
can be emotional contagion

1323
01:59:20,334 --> 01:59:22,834
or compassionate contagion
where one person in the room

1324
01:59:22,834 --> 01:59:24,801
is like, present.

1325
01:59:24,801 --> 01:59:27,701
And other people are like,
"Ooh, I feel that."

1326
01:59:27,701 --> 01:59:30,234
That's a positive side
of contagion.

1327
01:59:30,234 --> 01:59:33,367
Being touched by,
influenced by another person's

1328
01:59:33,367 --> 01:59:34,834
inner development.

1329
01:59:34,834 --> 01:59:36,701
So that's possible.

1330
01:59:36,701 --> 01:59:38,567
And we have evidence
that that's possible.

1331
01:59:38,567 --> 01:59:40,167
Yeah.

1332
01:59:40,167 --> 01:59:45,667
Ming: Maybe one last question,
if any.

1333
01:59:45,667 --> 01:59:47,801
woman: Um, maybe this
isn't as related.

1334
01:59:47,801 --> 01:59:51,667
But what's your view
on psychoanalysis and how--

1335
01:59:51,667 --> 01:59:54,534
Is that related at all or--

1336
01:59:54,534 --> 01:59:56,267
I mean, 'cause you
were kind of--

1337
01:59:56,267 --> 01:59:57,667
These are almost--

1338
01:59:57,667 --> 02:00:00,367
Sometimes I wonder
if there are kind of

1339
02:00:00,367 --> 02:00:02,434
bigger things
that would prevent mindfulness

1340
02:00:02,434 --> 02:00:05,868
or cognitive based
therapies from actually

1341
02:00:05,868 --> 02:00:07,901
taking as much effect.

1342
02:00:07,901 --> 02:00:10,567
Goldin: So Mark Epstein,
New York City,

1343
02:00:10,567 --> 02:00:13,234
psychoanalytically trained
psychotherapist,

1344
02:00:13,234 --> 02:00:15,501
also Buddhist practitioner.

1345
02:00:15,501 --> 02:00:17,367
He has several really good books

1346
02:00:17,367 --> 02:00:19,701
addressing exactly
this question.

1347
02:00:19,701 --> 02:00:23,167
Within psychotherapy approaches,
there's a wide range

1348
02:00:23,167 --> 02:00:24,901
of how people work.

1349
02:00:24,901 --> 02:00:26,234
And also it's
different skills

1350
02:00:26,234 --> 02:00:27,968
for different kinds
of problems.

1351
02:00:27,968 --> 02:00:30,334
You would treat elevator phobia
very different

1352
02:00:30,334 --> 02:00:33,534
than relationship phobia,
for example.

1353
02:00:33,534 --> 02:00:35,634
And also, you know,
you go back to Freud.

1354
02:00:35,634 --> 02:00:37,300
He talked about hovering--

1355
02:00:37,300 --> 02:00:38,868
Trying to get
the right vocabulary.

1356
02:00:38,868 --> 02:00:41,167
I think he said
"hovering awareness".

1357
02:00:41,167 --> 02:00:44,434
This ability to just let
the attention just rest

1358
02:00:44,434 --> 02:00:47,667
and hover and be aware.

1359
02:00:47,667 --> 02:00:49,367
And that actually could be--

1360
02:00:49,367 --> 02:00:51,367
That's one aspect of--

1361
02:00:51,367 --> 02:00:53,767
Resting in mindful awareness
with nothing to do,

1362
02:00:53,767 --> 02:00:57,000
nowhere to go,
just observing,

1363
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:58,300
and enjoying that.

1364
02:00:58,300 --> 02:01:01,067
So, in fact,
that could be something

1365
02:01:01,067 --> 02:01:03,968
that arises
from psychoanalytic practice.

1366
02:01:03,968 --> 02:01:06,067
So not just theory but practice.

1367
02:01:06,067 --> 02:01:08,501
So, yeah, I mean,
we're all humans.

1368
02:01:08,501 --> 02:01:11,033
And we can give
different vocabulary

1369
02:01:11,033 --> 02:01:14,334
but it's the same suffering
with slightly different flavors.

1370
02:01:14,334 --> 02:01:18,801
And it's the same tools
to restore well-being,

1371
02:01:18,801 --> 02:01:20,934
balanced,
psychological flexibility,

1372
02:01:20,934 --> 02:01:22,534
not being stuck.

1373
02:01:22,534 --> 02:01:25,534
And also believing that
I actually can do something.

1374
02:01:25,534 --> 02:01:28,801
That's one of the things that
arises in any form of therapy

1375
02:01:28,801 --> 02:01:30,467
or training
or even friendship--

1376
02:01:30,467 --> 02:01:32,734
True friendship is that,
"Oh, my gosh.

1377
02:01:32,734 --> 02:01:37,334
I can expand.
I can be more than this."

1378
02:01:37,334 --> 02:01:38,968
That is the sense.

1379
02:01:38,968 --> 02:01:40,167
Then you trust that
and you're hopeful

1380
02:01:40,167 --> 02:01:41,534
that something can happen.

1381
02:01:41,534 --> 02:01:42,801
I'm actually doing a study
on hopefulness

1382
02:01:42,801 --> 02:01:43,968
and hopelessness.

1383
02:01:43,968 --> 02:01:45,000
And it really is--

1384
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,400
You can actually see
in the brain.

1385
02:01:47,400 --> 02:01:50,200
You can differentiate
a hopeful state

1386
02:01:50,200 --> 02:01:51,634
or a hopelessness.

1387
02:01:51,634 --> 02:01:54,767
And even about
being able to develop.

1388
02:01:54,767 --> 02:01:57,334
Some people don't believe we can
train the brain.

1389
02:01:57,334 --> 02:01:59,467
And that's
kind of a hopeless state.

1390
