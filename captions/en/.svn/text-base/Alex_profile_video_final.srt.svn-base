00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:01,767
Moffat: I'm Alex Moffat,
the chief engineer

2
00:00:01,767 --> 00:00:03,300
for Lombardi Blueprint,

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,834
and I'm gonna show you
Blueprint,

4
00:00:04,834 --> 00:00:06,734
an app that we built
with Google Web Toolkit.

5
00:00:06,734 --> 00:00:10,501
So Blueprint is a business
process mapping tool

6
00:00:10,501 --> 00:00:12,501
for business users

7
00:00:12,501 --> 00:00:15,133
to collaboratively describe
their processes,

8
00:00:15,133 --> 00:00:16,334
and try
and get agreement

9
00:00:16,334 --> 00:00:18,334
about what
the processes actually are.

10
00:00:18,334 --> 00:00:21,167
So the tool--what they'd
be using instead of Blueprint

11
00:00:21,167 --> 00:00:23,167
is probably PowerPoint
or Visio.

12
00:00:23,167 --> 00:00:24,601
You can see here
in the app

13
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:25,701
that on the left-hand side

14
00:00:25,701 --> 00:00:27,901
we have an outline
of the process,

15
00:00:27,901 --> 00:00:30,267
and on the right-hand side,
we have sort of a map view.

16
00:00:30,267 --> 00:00:32,767
I can, uh, enter items
into the outline.

17
00:00:32,767 --> 00:00:35,267
And then I can do
some drag and drop.

18
00:00:35,267 --> 00:00:37,634
We also have, um,
a diagram view,

19
00:00:37,634 --> 00:00:39,200
which looks a lot more
like Visio.

20
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,801
I can switch to that now.

21
00:00:41,801 --> 00:00:43,567
Now the diagram
actually does

22
00:00:43,567 --> 00:00:45,868
automated, uh, layout
of the boxes

23
00:00:45,868 --> 00:00:47,334
and routing
of the lines.

24
00:00:47,334 --> 00:00:49,534
And all of this is happening
on the client in JavaScript,

25
00:00:49,534 --> 00:00:51,467
which is pretty remarkable.

26
00:00:51,467 --> 00:00:53,400
Everything that
you're seeing here is done--

27
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,834
is executing
in an ordinary browser

28
00:00:55,834 --> 00:00:57,300
in JavaScript.

29
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,200
There's no Flash or other
client-side plugins required.

30
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,234
And really, that's the benefit
that we get

31
00:01:02,234 --> 00:01:03,868
from Google Web Toolkit.

32
00:01:03,868 --> 00:01:07,834
We don't have to worry
about all of the browser quirks

33
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:10,567
that you fight with when
you're writing pure JavaScript.

34
00:01:10,567 --> 00:01:13,367
We just write in a language
that we like to use,

35
00:01:13,367 --> 00:01:15,467
and they take care of all
the difficult bits for us.
