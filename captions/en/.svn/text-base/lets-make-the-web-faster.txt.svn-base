Google is very interested improving the speed of the web because the web is the most important platform of our time.

0:00:12.670,0:00:19.459
And by making the web better and faster we not only make Google applications better but in fact all the applications

0:00:19.459,0:00:20.500
users know and love

0:00:20.709,0:00:27.289
We also believe that people are using the web more and more as a place to read, view video

0:00:27.729,0:00:32.889
In order for that information to be useful we need to make sure that it is delivered in a timely fashion.

0:00:33.519,0:00:39.619
You know I think we are just at the beginning of how fast we can make the web. It is hard for us to imagine the

0:00:39.869,0:00:45.299
improvements that we’ve made just in the last 15 years. If you think about how slow the web was when it initially

0:00:45.299,0:00:47.069
started and how far we’ve come

0:00:47.349,0:00:56.079
Larry Page expressed a vision of being able to go from webpage to webpage as quickly as you could turn the pages in a

0:00:56.559,0:00:57.750
glossy magazine

0:00:58.109,0:01:05.169
Uploading pictures, watching high definition movies, running very complex JavaScript based apps, all those things can

0:01:05.360,0:01:07.720
and should be instantaneous in the future.

0:01:08.519,0:01:15.830
Making the entire web faster is a big challenge and although Google is a major player in the internet, it can not move

0:01:15.830,0:01:17.219
the entire internet on its own

0:01:17.479,0:01:23.389
We all collectively have to work together and Google is very interested in helping move those initiatives forward;

0:01:23.720,0:01:30.220
helping software developers write applications that are faster, helping ISPs understand what is limiting their

0:01:30.220,0:01:30.700
networks.

0:01:30.699,0:01:38.509
We also plan to work with standards bodies to make the web protocols more speed friendly than what they are today.

0:01:38.919,0:01:50.289
If we could come up with changes, enhancements or even alternatives to TCP/IP, or HTTP you know that might have a

0:01:50.289,0:01:52.380
significant impact

0:01:52.649,0:02:01.819
We’ll have to advocate for it, we’ ll have to explain, talk about it, educate users, educate other companies and work

0:02:01.819,0:02:08.639
towards this. So this will be a series of difficult advocacy steps over a long period of time.

0:02:08.639,0:02:14.570
Making the web faster is important not just to Google but we believe it is important to everybody.

0:02:15.149,0:02:21.480
The web has become the dominant computing platform of our time. It is the platform by which people communicate

0:02:21.479,0:02:28.239
socially, it is the way we exchange ideas, it is the platform that runs the applications we care most about.

0:02:28.240,0:02:32.460
And by making the web as fast as it can be we think the whole world benefits

0:02:32.460,0:02:39.069
I think the most immediate impact will be the number of people using the web will just increase dramatically

0:02:39.229,0:02:47.659
You are going to see more high speed and faster performing phones and mobile devices in people’s hands

0:02:47.779,0:02:55.589
New markets can form, people will be making purchasing decisions on the spot instead of you know going back home and

0:02:55.589,0:02:57.360
sitting down at their computer.

0:02:57.580,0:03:06.110
So there are a lot of I think future benefits to be had and I think the world can really benefit from having

0:03:06.630,0:03:08.279
information access faster

0:03:08.960,0:03:17.559
We should also hold out as a goal, as an aspiration for what we could achieve by making the internet a faster place,

0:03:18.009,0:03:19.799
is raising the quality of life around the world.
