00:00:05,467 --> 00:00:08,334
Nikhil Chandhok:
Okay, I'm going to talk about
two specific products over here,

2
00:00:08,334 --> 00:00:10,634
one being AdSense video units.

3
00:00:10,634 --> 00:00:12,300
It's a way to, uh--

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,901
It's a syndication
and monetization product

5
00:00:15,901 --> 00:00:19,000
that we put approximately
six to eight months ago.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,734
And it's essentially targeted
at web publishers,

7
00:00:22,734 --> 00:00:25,434
who want to enhance their site
with monetized video.

8
00:00:25,434 --> 00:00:27,734
And then I'm going to talk
about custom players,

9
00:00:27,734 --> 00:00:29,167
which is another feature
of our site,

10
00:00:29,167 --> 00:00:32,667
which is a way for people
to actually display playlists

11
00:00:32,667 --> 00:00:34,000
on their site.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,133
A lot of what we--
A lot of you are already used

13
00:00:37,133 --> 00:00:39,601
to displaying embedded players,
like single clip embeds,

14
00:00:39,601 --> 00:00:40,934
on your site.

15
00:00:40,934 --> 00:00:43,868
But being able
to display a full playlist

16
00:00:43,868 --> 00:00:46,567
lets you write a richer story,
add more context to your site.

17
00:00:46,567 --> 00:00:49,767
So both of these are about--
These--

18
00:00:49,767 --> 00:00:52,901
Both of these concepts are
focused on web masters,

19
00:00:52,901 --> 00:00:54,300
web publishers, so to speak.

20
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,868
I know a lot of you guys
are API Developers.

21
00:00:56,868 --> 00:00:58,467
But I still think it
will be useful for you

22
00:00:58,467 --> 00:01:04,133
to understand all the--
all the syndication products

23
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:05,901
that YouTube provides.

24
00:01:05,901 --> 00:01:08,767
And maybe you can leverage
some of these products

25
00:01:08,767 --> 00:01:10,501
in an interesting way

26
00:01:10,501 --> 00:01:13,300
within your
application source websites.

27
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,200
So Video Units--
why should you care?

28
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,067
It's a way
to enhance your site.

29
00:01:19,067 --> 00:01:22,234
It's a way to enhance video,
add video to your site.

30
00:01:22,234 --> 00:01:24,167
And you say,
"Yep, I can do that already."

31
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:27,067
I can pick a player on YouTube,
I can add it to my site.

32
00:01:27,067 --> 00:01:30,133
And you know, the video plays,
I write a blog,

33
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:32,100
and I can add some text
around the blog,

34
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,501
and it's a fantastic solution.

35
00:01:33,501 --> 00:01:36,567
Well, what Video Units says,
lets you draw up

36
00:01:36,567 --> 00:01:38,234
a piece of code on your site,

37
00:01:38,234 --> 00:01:41,167
and it lets you
contextually target the video.

38
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:45,601
So, much like AdSense,
where AdSense is able

39
00:01:45,601 --> 00:01:48,601
to sense the page, and
figure out what is on the page,

40
00:01:48,601 --> 00:01:52,467
Video Units is able to figure
out what is on the page,

41
00:01:52,467 --> 00:01:55,334
figure out the relevant video
in our index

42
00:01:55,334 --> 00:01:57,367
that can be showed
against that page.

43
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,968
And then what are the ads
against that page?

44
00:01:59,968 --> 00:02:02,667
What are the ads
against the video and the page?

45
00:02:02,667 --> 00:02:05,334
And serve them all together
in one package solution,

46
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:07,701
which we'll walk through
right after this.

47
00:02:07,701 --> 00:02:10,834
So, it's about contextual video.

48
00:02:10,834 --> 00:02:14,133
And the last thing--the most
important thing, I think--

49
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:15,534
A lot of people
have asked me this question

50
00:02:15,534 --> 00:02:17,067
is, "How do you derive revenue?"

51
00:02:17,067 --> 00:02:20,167
It's our first monetization
product that we've put out

52
00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:21,801
as part of YouTube syndication.

53
00:02:21,801 --> 00:02:24,868
So it's a way for you to derive
revenues from the video itself,

54
00:02:24,868 --> 00:02:29,300
instead of--instead of deriving
revenue from the overall site

55
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,534
that you're building,
using the video, okay?

56
00:02:32,534 --> 00:02:34,834
And feel free to stop me
at any time with any questions,

57
00:02:34,834 --> 00:02:37,801
or clarifications that--
Can everybody hear me okay?

58
00:02:37,801 --> 00:02:40,234
Yep.
Okay.

59
00:02:40,234 --> 00:02:42,667
So how does it--
What does it mean?

60
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:46,267
So, normally
when you see a video on YouTube,

61
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:52,234
it has--this is an example
of an Audi A4 video on YouTube.

62
00:02:52,234 --> 00:02:55,868
It's got it's little--
it's playing on YouTube.

63
00:02:55,868 --> 00:02:57,267
And it's got this little
embedded player

64
00:02:57,267 --> 00:02:58,634
that you guys are used
to seeing.

65
00:02:58,634 --> 00:03:00,400
The Adsense Video Units
player

66
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,100
is actually a different kind
of player.

67
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,133
And you see this player--
If you look at the player,

68
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:07,734
it has a banner ad on the top.

69
00:03:07,734 --> 00:03:10,868
And the video is
still playing inside the player.

70
00:03:10,868 --> 00:03:13,534
And there is an in stream ad
on top of that.

71
00:03:13,534 --> 00:03:16,667
And what happens is--
And the concept is essentially

72
00:03:16,667 --> 00:03:19,801
this player gets syndicated
from YouTube,

73
00:03:19,801 --> 00:03:22,400
and then ends up on a
publisher's site,

74
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,267
where the publisher
is then syndicating the video

75
00:03:27,267 --> 00:03:28,400
for YouTube.

76
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,701
It is enhancing
the publisher's site,

77
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:32,868
and also the publisher
is participating

78
00:03:32,868 --> 00:03:34,167
in a three-way revenue share.

79
00:03:34,167 --> 00:03:37,901
So the way it work is,
the content--

80
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:40,067
the only content we can monetize

81
00:03:40,067 --> 00:03:42,601
is the content that comes
from YouTube partners.

82
00:03:42,601 --> 00:03:44,868
So it is not all the content
in the YouTube index,

83
00:03:44,868 --> 00:03:47,501
it's a section of that content

84
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:49,534
that we have verified
who the owner is,

85
00:03:49,534 --> 00:03:52,100
and now we can run ads
against this content.

86
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,734
So there's one big difference
around what content can flow on.

87
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,100
The content is bundled with ads.

88
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,267
So right here,
if you see up there,

89
00:04:00,267 --> 00:04:03,000
there's an ad unit that goes
with the content.

90
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,834
It's not just a standard
embedded player,

91
00:04:04,834 --> 00:04:09,234
where there is no ads;
the ads travel with the player.

92
00:04:09,234 --> 00:04:11,501
And the last part being,
it's a three-way revenue share.

93
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,767
And you might ask,

94
00:04:12,767 --> 00:04:14,801
"Who are the three parties
in the revenue share?"

95
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:17,033
Well, it's yourself,
who's the publisher,

96
00:04:17,033 --> 00:04:20,033
it's Google,
and it's the content-owner,

97
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:21,534
who is actually
giving us the content,

98
00:04:21,534 --> 00:04:25,234
and is--has not been
participating in the value chain

99
00:04:25,234 --> 00:04:28,000
so far, but it's our way
for help them make--

100
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,400
help them make some money.

101
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,067
So that more, and more good
content can flow in the system.

102
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:33,701
And everybody
in the ecosystem

103
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:36,734
can then derive the benefits
of syndication.

104
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:39,968
Any questions on this line?
Yeah?

105
00:04:39,968 --> 00:04:45,300
man:
Is it ever a two-way revenue
share where you don't have--

106
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,033
It's, like, maybe a popular
video, but it's [indistinct].

107
00:04:50,033 --> 00:04:51,701
I show it on my site,
I split it with Google,

108
00:04:51,701 --> 00:04:56,901
but that person never
sends it down.

109
00:04:56,901 --> 00:04:59,067
Chandhok:
Yeah.
No, we cannot do that.

110
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:02,000
Because I mean, the value has
been derived from the playback.

111
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,601
And, um...

112
00:05:04,601 --> 00:05:06,133
The lawyers would argue

113
00:05:06,133 --> 00:05:07,601
that most of the value
has been derived

114
00:05:07,601 --> 00:05:09,000
from the playback,
and we have to make sure

115
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,267
that we know who the owner is
before running an ad

116
00:05:11,267 --> 00:05:12,534
on the--on the video.

117
00:05:12,534 --> 00:05:13,868
man:
Thank you.

118
00:05:13,868 --> 00:05:15,367
Chandhok:
Sure.

119
00:05:15,367 --> 00:05:17,367
man:
Does the video--you mention
that it's sort

120
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:19,901
of contextually targeted,
does the video actually change

121
00:05:19,901 --> 00:05:21,634
based on what text is
on the screen?

122
00:05:21,634 --> 00:05:24,133
Chandhok:
Yep, it will change based on
what text is on the page.

123
00:05:24,133 --> 00:05:25,634
It'll change automatically.

124
00:05:25,634 --> 00:05:28,434
It'll change based on--as
new content comes in our index,

125
00:05:28,434 --> 00:05:31,934
we try to keep the videos
as fresh as possible.

126
00:05:31,934 --> 00:05:36,701
So the idea there is not just
about deriving revenue, right.

127
00:05:36,701 --> 00:05:39,234
Traditionally AdSense publishers
have looked at all AdSense units

128
00:05:39,234 --> 00:05:42,234
as a way to derive revenue,
and this is a way to deri--

129
00:05:42,234 --> 00:05:44,400
to drive engagement
in an automated fashion.

130
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,434
So I have a car blog,
and I put up this.

131
00:05:47,434 --> 00:05:49,801
One day it might be
an Audi video that shows up,

132
00:05:49,801 --> 00:05:53,434
another day it might be
a Honda video that shows up,

133
00:05:53,434 --> 00:05:55,200
but the idea there is
that we can show you

134
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,501
fresh and relevant content
at all times.

135
00:05:57,501 --> 00:06:00,334
man:
Okay, just as a follow-up,
so how is that relevant?

136
00:06:00,334 --> 00:06:03,701
Is it sort of calculated?
Is it based on the words?

137
00:06:03,701 --> 00:06:05,100
Chandhok:
Yeah.

138
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,734
Uh no, the relevance is--

139
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:08,501
So we get meta data associated
with the video,

140
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:09,868
that comes in with the video.

141
00:06:09,868 --> 00:06:11,767
And we max that meta data.

142
00:06:11,767 --> 00:06:13,300
We have
a traditional AdSense servers

143
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,834
that are figuring out
what ads to run on the page.

144
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:17,767
Those same AdSense servers
are figuring out

145
00:06:17,767 --> 00:06:19,200
what category the page is in.

146
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,133
So they figure out,
"Oh, this is a car page,

147
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:24,400
"so we need to go look into--
go look for a car video."

148
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,534
And then we have algorithms
in the back that figure out,

149
00:06:26,534 --> 00:06:30,000
"Okay, what's a popular car
video that monetizes well?"

150
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,300
That's going to be relevant
to this page.

151
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,701
And then we serve it up.

152
00:06:32,701 --> 00:06:36,200
When multiple signals going into
it, for like, the elements,

153
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:41,334
freshness, um, child safety--
all those things.

154
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:43,167
Because we want to make sure
that what we are syndicating

155
00:06:43,167 --> 00:06:44,701
is more or less safe.

156
00:06:44,701 --> 00:06:47,501
man:
So there's a basic piece
of the meta data there

157
00:06:47,501 --> 00:06:49,133
is captured during upload,
right?

158
00:06:49,133 --> 00:06:50,934
Chandhok:
Yeah, it's captured
on the video site.

159
00:06:50,934 --> 00:06:53,167
Yeah, on the video site
it's captured during upload.

160
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:55,234
But then again,
it's matched against the page.

161
00:06:55,234 --> 00:06:58,801
So we don't go into the spoken
word of the video, you're right.

162
00:06:58,801 --> 00:07:00,567
Okay?

163
00:07:00,567 --> 00:07:01,667
man #2:
Can I ask a question?

164
00:07:01,667 --> 00:07:03,400
Chandhok:
Sure.

165
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,534
man #2:
So on an international page,
do you have to take the content

166
00:07:05,534 --> 00:07:07,534
of the page
and send it back to Google?

167
00:07:07,534 --> 00:07:09,501
Chandhok:
No, I mean,
Google will crawl it.

168
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:11,167
If your participating
in AdSense,

169
00:07:11,167 --> 00:07:13,567
Google is automati--whenever
you sign up for AdSense,

170
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,133
you take a domain,
and you give it to AdSense.

171
00:07:15,133 --> 00:07:16,934
And you say, "Hey, I'm going
to run ads on this page."

172
00:07:16,934 --> 00:07:18,734
The way AdSense works,
is it comes--

173
00:07:18,734 --> 00:07:20,634
the crawlers come out,
they figure out the page,

174
00:07:20,634 --> 00:07:22,567
and then we pick up
the signals from the page.

175
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,868
And um...

176
00:07:24,868 --> 00:07:26,467
we target the video on the page.

177
00:07:26,467 --> 00:07:28,334
Sure.

178
00:07:28,334 --> 00:07:31,501
man #3:
So you're running basically,
a targeted video advertisement

179
00:07:31,501 --> 00:07:33,634
and a contextual advertisement
on top of it?

180
00:07:33,634 --> 00:07:36,367
Chandhok:
It's video content,
plus textual advertising.

181
00:07:36,367 --> 00:07:38,968
man #3:
That means that content is going
to be provided by the people

182
00:07:38,968 --> 00:07:40,801
who are syndicating it
on purpose.

183
00:07:40,801 --> 00:07:44,300
So for instance, if I had a car
on my page that had video,

184
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,601
it's probably being presented
by the manufacturer.

185
00:07:46,601 --> 00:07:48,000
Chandhok:
No, no, no.

186
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,234
It's a lot of our partners,
our regular partners,

187
00:07:50,234 --> 00:07:51,434
we have very big partners.

188
00:07:51,434 --> 00:07:53,901
I--Off the top of my head,
I don't know.

189
00:07:53,901 --> 00:07:57,634
So all our...
like, Lisa Nova, and Smosh--

190
00:07:57,634 --> 00:07:59,100
All of them are participating
in the program.

191
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,534
So you
have entertainment content,

192
00:08:00,534 --> 00:08:04,634
you have car content of course,
coming from car magazines.

193
00:08:04,634 --> 00:08:08,934
I'd like to say TalkGear
is a partner,

194
00:08:08,934 --> 00:08:11,467
but I don't remember if the BBC
is partnering with us on this.

195
00:08:11,467 --> 00:08:15,300
And we have a bunch of content
that is not advertorial.

196
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,300
So a goal of this content
is not advertorial content,

197
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:21,234
it is actually content
that is engaging and useful

198
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:23,501
to a user who is coming
on the site.

199
00:08:23,501 --> 00:08:25,968
And oh, by the way, the content,
it's high-value content,

200
00:08:25,968 --> 00:08:28,634
and the cost--typically you
would pay to syndicate.

201
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:31,400
As a publisher, you would pay
the owner of the content rights,

202
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,901
to actually get the content
on your site.

203
00:08:32,901 --> 00:08:35,601
In this case, we are saying,
"We'll support it with that.

204
00:08:35,601 --> 00:08:36,934
"It comes bundled.

205
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:38,567
"And the cost to you,
publisher, is nothing."

206
00:08:38,567 --> 00:08:39,701
Okay?

207
00:08:39,701 --> 00:08:41,934
Last question.
I got to move on to--

208
00:08:41,934 --> 00:08:44,901
man #4:
So is it possible that you could
be talking about content

209
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:46,968
for, say, a BMW car.

210
00:08:46,968 --> 00:08:48,033
Chandhok:
Yeah.

211
00:08:48,033 --> 00:08:51,334
man #4:
And starting off an Audi ad.

212
00:08:51,334 --> 00:08:54,400
Chandhok:
Uh, it could be an Audi--
depends, I don't know.

213
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,901
Hopefully, our systems
are not that stupid.

214
00:08:56,901 --> 00:08:59,767
[laughing]

215
00:08:59,767 --> 00:09:02,100
[man speaking indistinctly]

216
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,267
Chandhok:
Yeah, then you know,
it could pick up anything.

217
00:09:04,267 --> 00:09:07,567
Yeah, I mean, it's going to pick
up--it'll key off the key words.

218
00:09:07,567 --> 00:09:10,434
And that's just the challenge
of all contextual--

219
00:09:10,434 --> 00:09:12,167
The classic example is Java.

220
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:13,601
Are you talking about Java,
the language,

221
00:09:13,601 --> 00:09:14,701
or java, the coffee, right?
So...

222
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:16,200
[man speaking indistinctly

223
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,400
Chandhok:
Hopefully our Ad systems
are smarter than that.

224
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,801
Uh, what are the ad types?

225
00:09:20,801 --> 00:09:23,300
There are two types of ads.
Clearly, there's ads on top.

226
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,033
Which can be banner,
or text ads.

227
00:09:25,033 --> 00:09:28,634
So in the previous example, you
saw a text ad being on the top.

228
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:32,968
In this example, I have a banner
ad, which is a 468 by 60 unit,

229
00:09:32,968 --> 00:09:35,801
bundled with a video on the top.

230
00:09:35,801 --> 00:09:38,367
It can be CPC text
and image ads.

231
00:09:38,367 --> 00:09:40,267
It can be CP image ad
on the top.

232
00:09:40,267 --> 00:09:46,033
In Stream typically tends
to be a text ad or image ad,

233
00:09:46,033 --> 00:09:48,100
but it tends to be a CPC ad.

234
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,334
Okay?

235
00:09:49,334 --> 00:09:51,467
[short silence]

236
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:53,067
How do you configure this?

237
00:09:53,067 --> 00:09:55,767
It's much like AdSense in the
sense that you drop a piece

238
00:09:55,767 --> 00:09:58,968
of code on your site.

239
00:09:58,968 --> 00:10:00,367
The code is generated for you.

240
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:02,701
You configure your player
using your AdSense account.

241
00:10:02,701 --> 00:10:05,467
You are able to adjust the size
of the player.

242
00:10:05,467 --> 00:10:07,200
You're able to pick up
multiple player formats.

243
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,868
If you look over here,
there are five player formats.

244
00:10:08,868 --> 00:10:10,167
They're kind of small.

245
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:12,200
As I walk to the demo,
you'll see those.

246
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,734
And then the last,
and most interesting piece is

247
00:10:14,734 --> 00:10:18,033
you are able to focus the video
choices using key words

248
00:10:18,033 --> 00:10:19,367
and categories.

249
00:10:19,367 --> 00:10:22,968
So if I have an auto blog,
and let's say we have

250
00:10:22,968 --> 00:10:24,601
"Autos and Vehicles,"
as a category,

251
00:10:24,601 --> 00:10:27,400
And then we have "News and
Ent"--"News" also as a category.

252
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:32,200
So lets say I don't want
any news content on my site.

253
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,834
All I want is like,
good quality auto content.

254
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:37,667
So what I'm going to do
is just uncheck the "News" box.

255
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:39,901
I'm going
to uncheck the "Humor" box.

256
00:10:39,901 --> 00:10:42,234
I don't want anything funny
about cars on my site.

257
00:10:42,234 --> 00:10:45,400
So all I want is something
about "Autos and Vehicles,"

258
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,801
and all I want is that.

259
00:10:46,801 --> 00:10:48,567
If I'm not
an "Autos and Vehicles" site,

260
00:10:48,567 --> 00:10:51,667
if I'm an "Entertainment" site,
all I want it entertainment,

261
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:52,934
I'm gonna choose that.

262
00:10:52,934 --> 00:10:54,534
I'm going to start
getting the Smosh videos,

263
00:10:54,534 --> 00:10:55,934
the Lisa Nova videos,

264
00:10:55,934 --> 00:10:58,133
whatever else has
been syndicated in our index.

265
00:10:58,133 --> 00:11:00,400
If I just choose "News,"
I'm going to start

266
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,667
getting everything
that's being syndicated

267
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:03,467
by the local stations
on my site, right?

268
00:11:03,467 --> 00:11:05,968
So it's a combination of--
it gives you enough--

269
00:11:05,968 --> 00:11:08,400
You can choose all categories.
You can choose two categories.

270
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,734
You can choose three categories.
It's up to you.

271
00:11:10,734 --> 00:11:13,267
And then you can use keywords
to further inform us

272
00:11:13,267 --> 00:11:18,234
on how to do--on how
to optimize the targeting.

273
00:11:18,234 --> 00:11:21,033
Okay.

274
00:11:21,033 --> 00:11:24,734
Where do I--Where do you
go see your revenue in AdSense?

275
00:11:24,734 --> 00:11:28,934
Within Adsense, there is the
concept of AdSense for content.

276
00:11:28,934 --> 00:11:33,167
And within that, if you use--
if you are using AdSense ads

277
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:36,133
on your site today, it's
called "AdSense For Content."

278
00:11:36,133 --> 00:11:38,267
There's a channel
that gets created within that.

279
00:11:38,267 --> 00:11:40,167
It's called, "Video Units."

280
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:42,868
And you start seeing
your revenue flow through that.

281
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,767
Okay?

282
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,267
So this is pretty simple,
and once you drop it,

283
00:11:46,267 --> 00:11:47,868
the channel
gets created automatically.

284
00:11:47,868 --> 00:11:49,033
You sign up for it.

285
00:11:49,033 --> 00:11:50,701
Everything just starts flowing
into that.

286
00:11:50,701 --> 00:11:52,834
[short pause]

287
00:11:52,834 --> 00:11:54,300
Uh, demo.

288
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,767
So I'm gonna
quickly walk through

289
00:11:57,767 --> 00:12:00,501
what it means to do this.

290
00:12:00,501 --> 00:12:02,534
And so I'm--
This is my AdSense account.

291
00:12:02,534 --> 00:12:04,300
I've already logged into
my AdSense account.

292
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:10,100
And if I go into AdSense Setup,
which is their second tab,

293
00:12:11,601 --> 00:12:14,167
I can--I can then
see AdSense for Content,

294
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:16,834
which is the typical ads
that you drop on your site.

295
00:12:16,834 --> 00:12:20,267
AdSense for Search, Referrals,
which we are retiring,

296
00:12:20,267 --> 00:12:22,968
and then Video Units is the
fourth unit that was put out.

297
00:12:22,968 --> 00:12:25,367
And now we have
AdSense for Mobile Content.

298
00:12:25,367 --> 00:12:28,067
So when I click on Video Units,

299
00:12:28,067 --> 00:12:30,100
that just takes me
to my YouTube account.

300
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,767
So prior to this, uh--

301
00:12:32,767 --> 00:12:35,801
Prior to this talk,
I've gone ahead and linked

302
00:12:35,801 --> 00:12:37,634
my AdSense account
and my YouTube account.

303
00:12:37,634 --> 00:12:39,501
And the reason
we have to link those accounts

304
00:12:39,501 --> 00:12:42,367
is YouTube was an acquisition,
and they still haven't

305
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:45,734
migrated all our YouTube
accounts to Google accounts.

306
00:12:45,734 --> 00:12:48,734
Once we are done
with the migration of accounts,

307
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:50,234
it should be
a one-click process,

308
00:12:50,234 --> 00:12:52,634
and hopefully you don't have to
associate those two accounts.

309
00:12:52,634 --> 00:12:54,100
So for now,
you have to associate--

310
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,968
You have to go through the pain
of associating those accounts.

311
00:12:57,968 --> 00:13:02,033
And then I can create
an AdSense Player.

312
00:13:02,033 --> 00:13:06,133
And I can say, well--

313
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:12,067
"My car player."

314
00:13:12,067 --> 00:13:13,300
Can pick a color.

315
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,334
And so I pick blue.

316
00:13:16,334 --> 00:13:17,968
I'm gonna use
an expandable unit,

317
00:13:17,968 --> 00:13:19,934
which is a 728x90 unit,

318
00:13:19,934 --> 00:13:24,133
which is a standard
IB size unit.

319
00:13:24,133 --> 00:13:26,801
We have three units
which are not expandable.

320
00:13:26,801 --> 00:13:32,534
The 400x415, 500x510
which are more focused on--

321
00:13:32,534 --> 00:13:33,834
which are full-size units

322
00:13:33,834 --> 00:13:35,868
in the sense that they
are not IB standard units.

323
00:13:35,868 --> 00:13:39,334
There is no standard
IB video player size yet,

324
00:13:39,334 --> 00:13:42,567
so what we tried to do
was create expandable units

325
00:13:42,567 --> 00:13:44,167
that fit within
existing inventory

326
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:45,667
that publishers would have.

327
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:49,067
So 728x90 and 160x600.

328
00:13:49,067 --> 00:13:51,133
This is the other unit we have.

329
00:13:51,133 --> 00:13:52,667
It's a 160x600 unit.

330
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:53,701
It's a vertical unit

331
00:13:53,701 --> 00:13:55,434
which shows
a bunch of thumbnails,

332
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:56,701
and then you can
click on a thumbnail

333
00:13:56,701 --> 00:14:02,234
and it expands
into the playback experience.

334
00:14:02,234 --> 00:14:03,467
I can choose my content,

335
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:06,167
so I'm gonna
choose Autos & Vehicles,

336
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:10,534
and I'm going to
unselect everything else.

337
00:14:10,534 --> 00:14:13,934
We have bunch
of categories here.

338
00:14:13,934 --> 00:14:15,968
If it's a pet site,
you can put pet content.

339
00:14:15,968 --> 00:14:17,133
Gaming.

340
00:14:17,133 --> 00:14:18,834
We have a lot
of gaming content coming in

341
00:14:18,834 --> 00:14:20,534
after Spore was launched.

342
00:14:20,534 --> 00:14:22,834
A lot of people uploading
a lot of Spore content.

343
00:14:22,834 --> 00:14:25,567
All of that gets monetized
really, really well.

344
00:14:25,567 --> 00:14:30,067
And then I'm gonna
say Generate Code.

345
00:14:30,067 --> 00:14:32,701
And so my player was created.

346
00:14:32,701 --> 00:14:34,801
And this is the code
for the player.

347
00:14:34,801 --> 00:14:37,467
I accidentally created
a vertical player,

348
00:14:37,467 --> 00:14:39,100
but all what I have
embedded in my blog

349
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,501
is a horizontal player,
so I'm gonna show you that.

350
00:14:41,501 --> 00:14:44,200
So if I go here on Blogger,

351
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,234
where I've actually
embedded the player--

352
00:14:48,234 --> 00:14:51,434
It's a player about cars.

353
00:14:51,434 --> 00:14:57,367
And I'm able to scroll through
multiple videos over here.

354
00:14:57,367 --> 00:15:03,300
And I'm able to play
this video right here.

355
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,467
Right, so this is a car video
that got syndicated through us

356
00:15:06,467 --> 00:15:08,200
by one of our--

357
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,033
It's a video about--
classified as Autos & Vehicles

358
00:15:12,033 --> 00:15:15,234
that got syndicated to us
by one of our partners.

359
00:15:15,234 --> 00:15:16,701
On this one,
you're seeing a banner ad,

360
00:15:16,701 --> 00:15:18,567
which is of text,
and then in-stream ad,

361
00:15:18,567 --> 00:15:22,801
which is also around text.

362
00:15:22,801 --> 00:15:24,767
And you get paid every time
a user clicks on an ad,

363
00:15:24,767 --> 00:15:27,934
so if I click on this ad--

364
00:15:27,934 --> 00:15:31,033
User is taken off the site
and at that point

365
00:15:31,033 --> 00:15:36,534
there's a publisher payout event
that happened.

366
00:15:38,801 --> 00:15:44,701
So at this point I can
play another video.

367
00:15:44,701 --> 00:15:50,701
I can skip through videos.

368
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:54,400
If I went back here,
and I went back to this--

369
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,767
Sorry.

370
00:15:57,767 --> 00:16:00,000
I think I lost...

371
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,133
I could actually change
the category of the content.

372
00:16:04,133 --> 00:16:09,701
Right there, from...

373
00:16:11,434 --> 00:16:16,934
Instead of Autos & Vehicles,
I could choose Film & Animation.

374
00:16:18,334 --> 00:16:20,467
Save the player.

375
00:16:20,467 --> 00:16:26,467
And if I went back here,
and refresh this page,

376
00:16:26,467 --> 00:16:30,734
I have different content now,
showing up in the player.

377
00:16:30,734 --> 00:16:32,067
So again--so if you have
a network of sites

378
00:16:32,067 --> 00:16:33,801
that you're managing,

379
00:16:33,801 --> 00:16:36,167
it's the same piece--
you're creating one player.

380
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:37,567
And you had,
depending on if you have

381
00:16:37,567 --> 00:16:39,033
a class of websites
that you're managing,

382
00:16:39,033 --> 00:16:42,100
all you'd--you have one central
console to manage your players,

383
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,467
and then all this
monetized content

384
00:16:44,467 --> 00:16:45,767
being distributed on that site.

385
00:16:45,767 --> 00:16:47,667
So again, over here,
this is entertainment.

386
00:16:47,667 --> 00:16:50,634
Also, we chose Film & Animation.

387
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:55,834
So I don't know what this is,
but it's funny.

388
00:16:57,234 --> 00:16:58,501
Okay. Any questions on this?

389
00:16:58,501 --> 00:17:01,501
I have seven--
how many more minutes?

390
00:17:01,501 --> 00:17:03,868
Seven.
[chuckles]

391
00:17:03,868 --> 00:17:05,367
Sure, uh, black. In the black.

392
00:17:05,367 --> 00:17:06,801
woman: Could you
repeat what you said

393
00:17:06,801 --> 00:17:09,200
concerning having
a YouTube account

394
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,801
and, like, an AdSense--
if you have--

395
00:17:11,801 --> 00:17:12,801
I have an AdSense account.

396
00:17:12,801 --> 00:17:13,968
Chandhok: Yeah.

397
00:17:13,968 --> 00:17:15,167
woman: So what do I have to do?

398
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:18,267
Chandhok: So you--when you
go inside AdSense,

399
00:17:18,267 --> 00:17:20,901
you just click on...

400
00:17:20,901 --> 00:17:26,167
I'll show you.

401
00:17:27,567 --> 00:17:29,033
It's gonna log me in.

402
00:17:29,033 --> 00:17:31,634
You go to AdSense Setup.

403
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:34,400
And click on this link.
Click on Video Units.

404
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,934
And it'll walk you through
linking of the accounts.

405
00:17:36,934 --> 00:17:38,133
Okay?

406
00:17:38,133 --> 00:17:39,734
woman: That will take care
of your YouTube--

407
00:17:39,734 --> 00:17:42,901
Chandhok: Yeah. It'll walk you
through how to do that.

408
00:17:42,901 --> 00:17:43,901
Is there another question?

409
00:17:43,901 --> 00:17:45,234
Yeah.

410
00:17:45,234 --> 00:17:46,701
man: I'm still trying
to understand how to see--

411
00:17:46,701 --> 00:17:48,434
where three-way revenue
is gonna be going.

412
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,701
Chandhok: Sure.

413
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:52,534
The three-way revenue share
is essentially

414
00:17:52,534 --> 00:17:58,534
between yourself the publisher,
the content owner, and Google.

415
00:17:58,534 --> 00:17:59,934
Does that make sense?

416
00:17:59,934 --> 00:18:01,834
man: But who's paying?

417
00:18:01,834 --> 00:18:03,534
Chandhok: Who is paying?
The advertiser is paying.

418
00:18:03,534 --> 00:18:05,501
It's ad supported.

419
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:08,501
So when the ad runs,
somebody clicks on the ad

420
00:18:08,501 --> 00:18:10,167
or there's an
impression of the ad,

421
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:11,434
the advertiser is--

422
00:18:11,434 --> 00:18:13,667
Advertiser is paying
to advertise on that content

423
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:15,167
and on your site.

424
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:17,868
And when a click
happens on the ad,

425
00:18:17,868 --> 00:18:21,133
revenue is generated, and then
that revenue from that ad

426
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,100
is spread between
the three people

427
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,934
who are participating
in the syndication.

428
00:18:25,934 --> 00:18:28,000
man: So I have to have
a content platform,

429
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,734
and I can Google Survey the ads.

430
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,033
Chandhok: Yep.

431
00:18:31,033 --> 00:18:34,300
man: Somebody providing
some content or information.

432
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,534
Chandhok: Yep.

433
00:18:35,534 --> 00:18:38,033
man: And in order
to get to see that content,

434
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,734
I have to watch it there.

435
00:18:39,734 --> 00:18:42,400
Chandhok: Yep. It's the cost
of the content.

436
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,367
When you watch cable television,

437
00:18:44,367 --> 00:18:48,033
you are paying Comcast money
per month to watch television.

438
00:18:48,033 --> 00:18:49,834
On this, it's ad supported.
Right? So.

439
00:18:49,834 --> 00:18:52,868
[man speaking indistinctly]

440
00:18:52,868 --> 00:18:56,267
Chandhok: We try to optimize
for the highest rpm on that one.

441
00:18:56,267 --> 00:18:57,534
Yeah.

442
00:18:57,534 --> 00:18:59,601
man: You mentioned that
sport content modifies as well.

443
00:18:59,601 --> 00:19:01,033
Chandhok: Yeah.

444
00:19:01,033 --> 00:19:02,868
man: In that case, who do you
consider the content owner?

445
00:19:02,868 --> 00:19:05,267
Is it the guy who uploaded
that custom video?

446
00:19:05,267 --> 00:19:06,934
Or is it support?

447
00:19:06,934 --> 00:19:08,200
Chandhok: Uh, it's EA.

448
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,601
Because the sport is different,
because it is--

449
00:19:10,601 --> 00:19:12,834
It was created
within the environment,

450
00:19:12,834 --> 00:19:14,334
the EA environment.

451
00:19:14,334 --> 00:19:17,267
So EA actually owns the content.

452
00:19:17,267 --> 00:19:18,501
man: Even though it's user--

453
00:19:18,501 --> 00:19:20,968
Chandhok: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

454
00:19:20,968 --> 00:19:22,367
Yep?

455
00:19:22,367 --> 00:19:24,734
man: Do you plan on allowing
any further custom relation

456
00:19:24,734 --> 00:19:26,834
of the YouTube--

457
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:30,601
[man speaking indistinctly]

458
00:19:30,601 --> 00:19:33,234
Do you plan on
allowing more fine tuning?

459
00:19:33,234 --> 00:19:34,434
Chandhok: Yep.

460
00:19:34,434 --> 00:19:36,501
So we are looking
into providing more, like,

461
00:19:36,501 --> 00:19:38,767
different more formats,
which are more flexible.

462
00:19:38,767 --> 00:19:40,033
Last question; I gotta finish

463
00:19:40,033 --> 00:19:41,868
one other part
of the presentation.

464
00:19:41,868 --> 00:19:43,667
man: Since you mentioned
that the videos

465
00:19:43,667 --> 00:19:47,300
can only be monetized with
a deal with the content creator,

466
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:50,100
do you have an idea
of percentage-wise

467
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,634
what you see now, and what
you kind of expect to see,

468
00:19:52,634 --> 00:19:55,434
in terms of video served,
as to which--

469
00:19:55,434 --> 00:19:56,834
how many videos are monetized?

470
00:19:56,834 --> 00:19:59,067
Are we talking, like, 1-2% now,

471
00:19:59,067 --> 00:20:01,400
maybe growing to 10
by the end of the year?

472
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,300
Chandhok: I can't give
exact numbers, but in absolute--

473
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,067
I can't give exact
percentages of, like,

474
00:20:06,067 --> 00:20:08,667
how much of the corpus
is monetizable,

475
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:11,133
but in absolute numbers of,
like, con--

476
00:20:11,133 --> 00:20:14,734
We are the largest
cleared content depository

477
00:20:14,734 --> 00:20:17,400
on the internet.

478
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,767
And I can make that claim.

479
00:20:19,767 --> 00:20:22,901
It's large enough that you
will not run out of content.

480
00:20:22,901 --> 00:20:24,334
That's what I'm gonna say.

481
00:20:24,334 --> 00:20:25,434
Okay?

482
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:26,767
I don't have
a good answer to that

483
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,133
because then I'd be giving
private information.

484
00:20:29,133 --> 00:20:32,567
Okay, there's one other
thing I wanna share.

485
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:34,734
I'm gonna do it very quickly.

486
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:38,567
So what we just discussed
was about video,

487
00:20:38,567 --> 00:20:40,934
and it was about
building contextually--

488
00:20:40,934 --> 00:20:42,167
bringing context--
[clears throat]

489
00:20:42,167 --> 00:20:43,434
Sorry.

490
00:20:43,434 --> 00:20:45,501
Bringing contextually targeted
video to your site

491
00:20:45,501 --> 00:20:47,334
and have it supported by ads,

492
00:20:47,334 --> 00:20:49,100
and then deriving
revenue from that.

493
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,067
We have another
feature on our site,

494
00:20:51,067 --> 00:20:53,200
which we call Custom Players,

495
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,701
which is a simple way
for you to embed playlists

496
00:20:55,701 --> 00:20:57,067
on your site.

497
00:20:57,067 --> 00:20:59,934
So everybody's familiar
with embedding single players,

498
00:20:59,934 --> 00:21:01,467
but not a lot of people know

499
00:21:01,467 --> 00:21:04,868
how to embed playlists
on their site.

500
00:21:04,868 --> 00:21:06,801
Again, we have multiple
player formats here.

501
00:21:06,801 --> 00:21:10,934
We have a full page player
with thumbnails along with that,

502
00:21:10,934 --> 00:21:12,133
and then we have
a smaller player,

503
00:21:12,133 --> 00:21:15,467
which kind of cycles
through the playlist.

504
00:21:15,467 --> 00:21:17,234
You can display any
YouTube playlist through this.

505
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,133
It is not limited
like video units.

506
00:21:19,133 --> 00:21:21,000
Because there is
no monetization, right?

507
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,267
So all the content in the index
is available to syndicate,

508
00:21:26,267 --> 00:21:28,501
and again, much like the--
the demo you just saw,

509
00:21:28,501 --> 00:21:30,501
you can change
the playlist on the fly,

510
00:21:30,501 --> 00:21:32,267
and the players
update everywhere.

511
00:21:32,267 --> 00:21:35,300
So it's a very
simple thing to use.

512
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,567
How do you configure it?

513
00:21:36,567 --> 00:21:40,067
Again, you do it
through your account.

514
00:21:40,067 --> 00:21:42,234
It's--You choose your videos,
you choose your player,

515
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:44,434
you choose--you choose
the colors of the player,

516
00:21:44,434 --> 00:21:46,801
and then you choose the playlist
you want to embed in.

517
00:21:46,801 --> 00:21:48,200
So I'm going to
quickly demo this

518
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,067
because I have two more minutes.

519
00:21:51,067 --> 00:21:53,334
So if I go to my account,

520
00:21:53,334 --> 00:21:55,234
I click on Account.

521
00:21:55,234 --> 00:22:00,300
I can go to what is called
Custom Video Players.

522
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,901
And I can create
a custom player.

523
00:22:02,901 --> 00:22:08,367
So, this one I'm going to
call Spore Videos.

524
00:22:08,367 --> 00:22:10,734
Make it pink.

525
00:22:10,734 --> 00:22:14,000
I'm gonna choose
the small one over here.

526
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,300
This is a playlist
I created in the past

527
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,667
when we launched the Spore--

528
00:22:18,667 --> 00:22:20,100
when we launched Spore
a couple of weeks ago.

529
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,033
It's a bunch of Spore videos.

530
00:22:22,033 --> 00:22:25,367
And then I'm going to
say Select.

531
00:22:25,367 --> 00:22:29,467
Generate code.

532
00:22:29,467 --> 00:22:33,534
Go to Blogger.

533
00:22:33,534 --> 00:22:39,467
Make a new post.

534
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:53,334
So now I'm gonna be able to play
my Spore videos right there.

535
00:22:53,334 --> 00:22:54,767
So you can see the little--

536
00:22:54,767 --> 00:22:56,767
what we like to call
the Genie pop up

537
00:22:56,767 --> 00:23:00,267
with all the videos over here.

538
00:23:00,267 --> 00:23:02,300
[video's music playing quietly]

539
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:06,033
I can skip through videos.

540
00:23:06,033 --> 00:23:07,834
I mean, I can watch these
for hours, but...

541
00:23:07,834 --> 00:23:09,267
[audience laughs]

542
00:23:09,267 --> 00:23:11,400
man: Is it, like,
an automatic--

543
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,767
Chandhok: Yeah, it automatically
cycles through, and, like, uh...

544
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,167
And if you go back--

545
00:23:15,167 --> 00:23:16,234
I can go back and make this

546
00:23:16,234 --> 00:23:18,334
a Joe Biden playlist,
if I wanted to.

547
00:23:18,334 --> 00:23:19,834
It's all controlled
from the back.

548
00:23:19,834 --> 00:23:21,434
Sorry, go ahead.
There's a question.

549
00:23:21,434 --> 00:23:23,033
man: Most of this is

550
00:23:23,033 --> 00:23:26,434
from a different paced
current generated...

551
00:23:26,434 --> 00:23:27,934
I know you guys have
a subset player

552
00:23:27,934 --> 00:23:30,000
for industry
password combinations

553
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,534
for a popular drawing platform
and other services.

554
00:23:32,534 --> 00:23:36,367
Is there a philosophy on that
on how to do the syndication

555
00:23:36,367 --> 00:23:39,400
if I mail stuff,
can I paste in that code,

556
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,000
or it could be
supported in more other

557
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,467
subscription files
that are more automatic.

558
00:23:44,467 --> 00:23:46,434
Chandhok: We want to get
as automatic as possible,

559
00:23:46,434 --> 00:23:48,501
so, I mean, the way--

560
00:23:48,501 --> 00:23:50,400
The direction
I want to move in is

561
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,167
all of this
is programmable to an API.

562
00:23:53,167 --> 00:23:54,767
So any platform, like,

563
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:57,501
if you have word press,
or automatic out there,

564
00:23:57,501 --> 00:23:59,868
using our APIs
and embedding the players.

565
00:23:59,868 --> 00:24:02,801
I mean, the more--We have no--

566
00:24:02,801 --> 00:24:05,634
I think if you're not sensitive
to one channel or the other.

567
00:24:05,634 --> 00:24:08,701
Right? So any channel
that works is good for us.

568
00:24:08,701 --> 00:24:10,734
man: The biggest
alteration you might make

569
00:24:10,734 --> 00:24:13,133
is if in the future, especially
if it optimizes the platform--

570
00:24:13,133 --> 00:24:14,133
Chandhok: Yep.

571
00:24:14,133 --> 00:24:15,467
man: Somebody walked in--

572
00:24:15,467 --> 00:24:16,601
[man speaking indistinctly]

573
00:24:16,601 --> 00:24:17,601
--walked into
a lot of their own files.

574
00:24:17,601 --> 00:24:19,033
Do you get more--

575
00:24:19,033 --> 00:24:20,567
Chandhok: Yeah, so this player
actually then has to become

576
00:24:20,567 --> 00:24:23,334
an open social gadget;
it has to become smarter.

577
00:24:23,334 --> 00:24:25,467
Right now, it doesn't know
how to talk to the container.

578
00:24:25,467 --> 00:24:26,968
man: It might be cool,
if you go

579
00:24:26,968 --> 00:24:27,968
in that direction
with the actual--

580
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:29,033
you have to have syndication...

581
00:24:29,033 --> 00:24:33,200
[man speaking indistinctly]

582
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,601
Chandhok: Yeah. Yeah. I mean...

583
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:37,000
It's a good idea.
[chuckles]

584
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,267
I should do it.

585
00:24:38,267 --> 00:24:40,000
[audience laughs]
[man speaks indistinctly]

586
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,300
[Chandhok laughs]

587
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,033
Um, I mean, I can't say--

588
00:24:45,033 --> 00:24:47,934
You might be
the first person to think of it.

589
00:24:47,934 --> 00:24:49,634
It's all--We're always
looking for feedback.

590
00:24:49,634 --> 00:24:52,300
So, well, I mean, we are
constantly evolving the player.

591
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,467
I know that the player
is dumb today.

592
00:24:54,467 --> 00:24:56,667
So, but it runs
on MySpace, right,

593
00:24:56,667 --> 00:24:57,901
so, it's got--

594
00:24:57,901 --> 00:24:59,634
it's a Flash Player,
it runs on MySpace.

595
00:24:59,634 --> 00:25:02,667
All the pages on MySpace
are not really container pages.

596
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:05,367
There's this
little container section,

597
00:25:05,367 --> 00:25:07,667
and that's not really
flexible enough for us to, like,

598
00:25:07,667 --> 00:25:09,100
move the player.

599
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,934
I mean, we would like to have
a smarter version of the player,

600
00:25:10,934 --> 00:25:13,200
it's just not enough
container pages out there.

601
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,868
man: You're saying that
the content index, like,

602
00:25:14,868 --> 00:25:18,434
makes it a much higher bar
for the average person...

603
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:20,868
Chandhok: Yeah.
It does, it does.

604
00:25:20,868 --> 00:25:21,868
Anything else?

605
00:25:21,868 --> 00:25:22,868
Yeah.

606
00:25:22,868 --> 00:25:24,200
man: Is there a way to show--

607
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,000
for the videos that are
playing in the playlist,

608
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,567
is there a way to show the title
and descriptions as they play?

609
00:25:29,567 --> 00:25:32,000
Chandhok: Um, no,
but we should--

610
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,501
Hopefully we put out an API
which lets you query the player,

611
00:25:35,501 --> 00:25:39,567
and then you can
manage that yourself.

612
00:25:39,567 --> 00:25:42,501
[coughs]

613
00:25:42,501 --> 00:25:45,801
Any other questions?

614
00:25:45,801 --> 00:25:47,834
Okay. Thank you.

615
00:25:47,834 --> 00:25:51,968
[applause]
