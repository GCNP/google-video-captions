00:00:05,801 --> 00:00:07,200
Sahim: Hi, my name's Susie,

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,167
and I'm from the Doodle team
at Google.

3
00:00:09,167 --> 00:00:10,767
So I'm gonna show you
a few tips

4
00:00:10,767 --> 00:00:13,901
that we use to make sure that
pages load faster on the Web.

5
00:00:13,901 --> 00:00:15,567
One easy tip is to crop out

6
00:00:15,567 --> 00:00:17,601
any excess white space
in your graphic.

7
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:20,734
Another tip is to use
the correct file format

8
00:00:20,734 --> 00:00:21,834
for your graphics.

9
00:00:21,834 --> 00:00:24,000
Now let's go
to the computer demo.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,834
So here I am
in Adobe Photoshop.

11
00:00:25,834 --> 00:00:27,467
First I'm gonna crop
this image

12
00:00:27,467 --> 00:00:32,834
'cause I've got a lot
of excess white space here.

13
00:00:32,834 --> 00:00:35,968
Now I'm gonna go to File,
Save for Web & Devices.

14
00:00:35,968 --> 00:00:38,567
Now this
is where all the magic happens.

15
00:00:38,567 --> 00:00:41,868
Looks like GIF is much smaller.

16
00:00:41,868 --> 00:00:43,133
So we're gonna go
with GIF,

17
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:45,334
but I'm gonna optimize it
even more

18
00:00:45,334 --> 00:00:47,868
by adjusting the amount
of colors.

19
00:00:47,868 --> 00:00:50,534
We could bring it all the way
down to 16 colors,

20
00:00:50,534 --> 00:00:52,634
and the artwork
has hardly changed at all.

21
00:00:52,634 --> 00:00:57,000
And the size of this file format
is only 2K.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,934
Now here is another piece
of artwork

23
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:03,234
that is completely opposite
of the last one we saw.

24
00:01:03,234 --> 00:01:06,467
This one is really detailed
and full of tons of color.

25
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:10,734
Let's see how we can optimize
this one.

26
00:01:10,734 --> 00:01:14,167
So I'm gonna crop it
just like I did before.

27
00:01:14,167 --> 00:01:16,968
I'm gonna go to Save for Web,

28
00:01:16,968 --> 00:01:19,534
and I'm gonna try GIF first
'cause GIF worked so well

29
00:01:19,534 --> 00:01:21,367
for us last time.

30
00:01:21,367 --> 00:01:24,367
But, oh, man, you can't see it
on your screen,

31
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:26,400
but on mine it looks horrible.

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,167
I'm losing
all that beautiful detail.

33
00:01:29,167 --> 00:01:34,434
So I'm going to try JPEG.

34
00:01:34,434 --> 00:01:36,100
Oh, it looks so much better.

35
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,734
It's like
you're actually there.

36
00:01:39,734 --> 00:01:42,067
So hopefully you've learned
something cool and new

37
00:01:42,067 --> 00:01:44,601
about how to optimize graphics
on the Web.

38
00:01:44,601 --> 00:01:48,000

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,067
