1
00:00:00,801 --> 00:00:03,934
man:
Good evening, everybody.

2
00:00:03,934 --> 00:00:07,501
Wow, it's standing room only
back there.

3
00:00:07,501 --> 00:00:08,701
I'm going to get started,

4
00:00:08,701 --> 00:00:12,200
so everybody take a seat,
if you want.

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,501
Thanks for coming out
this evening.

6
00:00:14,501 --> 00:00:18,033
Today is App Engine's
first birthday.

7
00:00:18,033 --> 00:00:19,033
[cheers and applause]

8
00:00:19,033 --> 00:00:20,367
It's been one year--

9
00:00:20,367 --> 00:00:21,734
Thanks.

10
00:00:21,734 --> 00:00:24,133
It's been one year
since we launched App Engine,

11
00:00:24,133 --> 00:00:26,667
and so today--tonight
is a perfect time to tell you

12
00:00:26,667 --> 00:00:28,033
about a bunch of new features

13
00:00:28,033 --> 00:00:29,634
that we're going to be
launching.

14
00:00:29,634 --> 00:00:31,033
But before we do that,

15
00:00:31,033 --> 00:00:32,267
I want to take a quick look back

16
00:00:32,267 --> 00:00:34,133
at what we've done
over the past year.

17
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:35,968
I want to give you
a brief refresher

18
00:00:35,968 --> 00:00:37,634
about the design goals
for App Engine,

19
00:00:37,634 --> 00:00:38,968
and I want to tell you about

20
00:00:38,968 --> 00:00:41,267
the progress that we've made
in the past year.

21
00:00:41,267 --> 00:00:43,701
So, when we launched
App Engine last year,

22
00:00:43,701 --> 00:00:45,601
we made the following
observation.

23
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:47,167
It's way too hard

24
00:00:47,167 --> 00:00:48,834
to build and deploy
web applications.

25
00:00:48,834 --> 00:00:50,133
You can see a list

26
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,033
of all the stuff you have
to worry about up there,

27
00:00:52,033 --> 00:00:54,400
between Apache server configs

28
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,868
and database resharding

29
00:00:55,868 --> 00:00:57,067
and a bunch of other stuff.

30
00:00:57,067 --> 00:00:58,667
There's just way too much
to worry about.

31
00:00:58,667 --> 00:01:00,267
You spend more time
being a sysadmin

32
00:01:00,267 --> 00:01:03,501
than actually building
your next great web app,

33
00:01:03,501 --> 00:01:05,834
so we wanted to change that
with App Engine.

34
00:01:05,834 --> 00:01:07,267
With App Engine,

35
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:09,267
you deploy your app
on Google infrastructure,

36
00:01:09,267 --> 00:01:12,534
and that means it's free
and easy to get started

37
00:01:12,534 --> 00:01:13,801
and also to scale,

38
00:01:13,801 --> 00:01:15,934
and that means that we
relieve you of the burden

39
00:01:15,934 --> 00:01:18,734
of dealing with a lot
of the sysadmin issues.

40
00:01:18,734 --> 00:01:20,234
As a developer myself,

41
00:01:20,234 --> 00:01:21,834
that's a really compelling
proposition.

42
00:01:21,834 --> 00:01:23,767
I really like the idea
of being able to think about

43
00:01:23,767 --> 00:01:25,000
how my app can be better,

44
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,734
rather than thinking about
how to keep my app

45
00:01:26,734 --> 00:01:28,000
up and running.

46
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,934
So developers have been
really enthusiastic about this.

47
00:01:30,934 --> 00:01:34,100
Since we launched,
we've had 150,000 developers

48
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,968
who've built more than 50,000
applications on App Engine,

49
00:01:36,968 --> 00:01:39,567
including apps like BuddyPoke,

50
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:42,033
which is one of the most popular
open, social apps.

51
00:01:42,033 --> 00:01:43,434
App Engine helped BuddyPoke

52
00:01:43,434 --> 00:01:45,934
scale to more than
35 million users.

53
00:01:45,934 --> 00:01:47,701
That's really great.
That's huge.

54
00:01:47,701 --> 00:01:48,701
[applause]

55
00:01:48,701 --> 00:01:50,133
Congratulations to BuddyPoke.

56
00:01:50,133 --> 00:01:51,133
[cheering]

57
00:01:51,133 --> 00:01:52,167
[laughs]

58
00:01:52,167 --> 00:01:55,501
Brands like Best Buy,
eBay, and Forbes

59
00:01:55,501 --> 00:01:56,934
have started to outsource

60
00:01:56,934 --> 00:01:59,801
pieces of their computing
infrastructure to App Engine,

61
00:01:59,801 --> 00:02:02,667
and also Google has been
adopting App Engine internally.

62
00:02:02,667 --> 00:02:03,667
We have migrated--

63
00:02:03,667 --> 00:02:05,067
In the past six months alone,

64
00:02:05,067 --> 00:02:07,300
we have migrated
more than 50 applications.

65
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,434
And I want to talk about

66
00:02:08,434 --> 00:02:10,400
one of those applications
in particular,

67
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,834
and that's Google Moderator.

68
00:02:11,834 --> 00:02:13,133
Google Moderator is built

69
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,667
with App Engine on the back end,

70
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,667
and Google Web Toolkit
on the front end.

71
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:18,167
And we originally
built Moderator

72
00:02:18,167 --> 00:02:19,701
as a way for Google employees

73
00:02:19,701 --> 00:02:22,100
to ask questions
in internal company meetings,

74
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,901
but a few weeks ago,

75
00:02:23,901 --> 00:02:26,701
WhiteHouse.gov
used Google Moderator

76
00:02:26,701 --> 00:02:29,033
to solicit questions
from all around the world

77
00:02:29,033 --> 00:02:30,067
for a big town hall.

78
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:32,400
So here's a graph
of the traffic.

79
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,133
You can see we launched
the product here.

80
00:02:35,133 --> 00:02:36,667
Watch out for that.

81
00:02:36,667 --> 00:02:38,767
Here we started to get
some press coverage,

82
00:02:38,767 --> 00:02:41,133
and then here, what happened
with that big spike

83
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:45,100
is that right at the end
of the town hall,

84
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,234
people rushed in to get
their questions in

85
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:49,834
at the last minute before
the town hall closed down,

86
00:02:49,834 --> 00:02:51,300
so you can see
there's this big spike

87
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,167
right when everybody's trying
to get their questions in.

88
00:02:54,167 --> 00:02:56,334
Now, with a traditional
hosting provider,

89
00:02:56,334 --> 00:02:58,167
You would have had to predict

90
00:02:58,167 --> 00:03:00,000
the load that you
were going to get,

91
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,934
the traffic
that you were going to get,

92
00:03:01,934 --> 00:03:03,000
and you would have had

93
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,334
to pre-provision
a bunch of machines

94
00:03:05,334 --> 00:03:06,868
to take care
of your predicted load,

95
00:03:06,868 --> 00:03:08,567
and in fact,
you probably would have added

96
00:03:08,567 --> 00:03:09,567
a bunch more machines,

97
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:11,067
because in the happy event

98
00:03:11,067 --> 00:03:12,467
that you get
a lot of extra traffic,

99
00:03:12,467 --> 00:03:14,300
you don't want
to have the app crash.

100
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,834
So the great thing
about App Engine

101
00:03:16,834 --> 00:03:18,434
is that you didn't
have to do any of that.

102
00:03:18,434 --> 00:03:20,801
App Engine automatically
allocates resources

103
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,300
on your app's behalf.

104
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,334
It allows WhiteHouse.gov's
instance of Moderator

105
00:03:25,334 --> 00:03:27,434
to automatically
adjust and scale

106
00:03:27,434 --> 00:03:29,901
to these swings and surges
and spikes in traffic.

107
00:03:29,901 --> 00:03:32,467
I think that's a really
compelling testament

108
00:03:32,467 --> 00:03:33,734
to the power of App Engine,

109
00:03:33,734 --> 00:03:35,634
that you can take
an application like Moderator

110
00:03:35,634 --> 00:03:37,267
that was originally intended
to answer

111
00:03:37,267 --> 00:03:39,334
20 questions in an internal
company meeting,

112
00:03:39,334 --> 00:03:40,801
turn that into an application

113
00:03:40,801 --> 00:03:42,968
that took more than
three and a half million votes

114
00:03:42,968 --> 00:03:44,033
across a couple of days.

115
00:03:44,033 --> 00:03:45,467
That's really exciting.

116
00:03:45,467 --> 00:03:47,667
Okay, so that's what we've been
doing in the past year.

117
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:49,267
I guess the other thing
we've been doing

118
00:03:49,267 --> 00:03:51,534
in the past year
is soliciting feedback

119
00:03:51,534 --> 00:03:52,901
from all of you,

120
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:55,501
from developers out there
who are using App Engine,

121
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:56,968
and so based on that feedback,

122
00:03:56,968 --> 00:03:58,968
we have a bunch
of exciting new features

123
00:03:58,968 --> 00:04:00,167
to launch tonight.

124
00:04:00,167 --> 00:04:01,968
I'm going to give you
a quick overview,

125
00:04:01,968 --> 00:04:03,434
and then Kevin's
going to come up

126
00:04:03,434 --> 00:04:04,834
and give you all the details.

127
00:04:04,834 --> 00:04:07,234
So one thing that we're
going to talk about tonight

128
00:04:07,234 --> 00:04:09,868
is the ability to buy
additional quota

129
00:04:09,868 --> 00:04:12,601
beyond the free quota that all
App Engine applications get.

130
00:04:12,601 --> 00:04:15,300
So that means your app can scale
as big as you want it to get.

131
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,133
We're going to talk about
cron support,

132
00:04:17,133 --> 00:04:18,601
so that you can schedule tasks

133
00:04:18,601 --> 00:04:19,901
at particular intervals,

134
00:04:19,901 --> 00:04:21,534
and then
we'll execute them for you.

135
00:04:21,534 --> 00:04:23,434
We're going to talk about
database import,

136
00:04:23,434 --> 00:04:25,400
which lets you take big chunks
of application data

137
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,000
outside of App Engine
and push them into App Engine,

138
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,467
and we're going to talk about
access to firewall data,

139
00:04:30,467 --> 00:04:32,667
which allows App Engine
and also other Google apps

140
00:04:32,667 --> 00:04:33,968
like Google spreadsheets

141
00:04:33,968 --> 00:04:35,667
to communicate and cooperate

142
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:38,000
with applications running inside
your corporate network,

143
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,767
and then last but not least,

144
00:04:39,767 --> 00:04:44,367
last year we promised to support
languages other than Python,

145
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,534
and so
I'm really excited tonight

146
00:04:46,534 --> 00:04:48,667
to give you guys
an early preview

147
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:51,167
of Java language support
on App Engine.

148
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:53,067
I think this is going to
open App Engine--

149
00:04:53,067 --> 00:04:54,067
[audience cheers]

150
00:04:54,067 --> 00:04:56,267
...up to...wow.

151
00:04:56,267 --> 00:05:02,534
[laughs]

152
00:05:02,534 --> 00:05:03,534
Back to the fire.

153
00:05:03,534 --> 00:05:04,868
I think
the Java language support

154
00:05:04,868 --> 00:05:05,968
is going to open App Engine up

155
00:05:05,968 --> 00:05:07,367
to a whole new group
of developers,

156
00:05:07,367 --> 00:05:08,634
so I'm really
excited about it.

157
00:05:08,634 --> 00:05:10,801
And with that, I want to
hand things over to Kevin Gibbs,

158
00:05:10,801 --> 00:05:12,167
who's the tech lead.

159
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:14,100
He's going to give you
all the technical details.

160
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,100
Thanks.

161
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,868
[applause]

162
00:05:19,868 --> 00:05:21,667
Gibbs: Thanks, Graham.

163
00:05:21,667 --> 00:05:23,200
Well, over the past year,

164
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,834
since we've launched App Engine,

165
00:05:24,834 --> 00:05:27,200
we've really been listening
to your feedback.

166
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,467
You have guys have called out

167
00:05:28,467 --> 00:05:30,634
a number of areas
for improvement in App Engine,

168
00:05:30,634 --> 00:05:32,167
and we've been listening.

169
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:34,968
So, in response, we've added
a lot of features to App Engine

170
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:36,501
which, if you've been
watching, you've seen.

171
00:05:36,501 --> 00:05:38,400
Things like
our system status site,

172
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,567
where it shows live,
uptime information;

173
00:05:40,567 --> 00:05:44,033
HTTPS support,
our Memcache API,

174
00:05:44,033 --> 00:05:46,200
tons of new features
for the admin console,

175
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,300
and more.

176
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,534
Now, we know we still have
lots left to do,

177
00:05:49,534 --> 00:05:51,534
but I want to thank you
for the feedback,

178
00:05:51,534 --> 00:05:53,501
both positive and negative
that you've given us,

179
00:05:53,501 --> 00:05:54,901
because it really lets us know

180
00:05:54,901 --> 00:05:56,834
what we're doing right
and what we're doing wrong

181
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:58,100
and how we can improve.

182
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,968
But one of the biggest
features you asked

183
00:05:59,968 --> 00:06:01,367
that we've gotten
from you guys

184
00:06:01,367 --> 00:06:02,567
over the past year

185
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:04,601
has been that you want
the ability to grow

186
00:06:04,601 --> 00:06:06,467
beyond the free quotas
in App Engine.

187
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:08,968
You want to have
the ability to pay us

188
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:10,501
to use more App Engine,

189
00:06:10,501 --> 00:06:13,300
to allow your app to continue
to scale out.

190
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,868
Well, because of that,

191
00:06:14,868 --> 00:06:16,467
I'm happy
that about a month ago

192
00:06:16,467 --> 00:06:17,701
we launched the ability

193
00:06:17,701 --> 00:06:20,067
to pay for additional
resources on App Engine,

194
00:06:20,067 --> 00:06:21,767
our new billing support.

195
00:06:21,767 --> 00:06:24,033
Now, with our billing support
for App Engine,

196
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:25,000
it's very easy.

197
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,267
You just sign up,

198
00:06:26,267 --> 00:06:28,968
set a budget for each
resource you want to use--

199
00:06:28,968 --> 00:06:31,400
like CPU and bandwidth
and so on--

200
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,200
and then you can scale
your application out

201
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,901
to your heart's content.

202
00:06:34,901 --> 00:06:38,133
You only pay for exactly
the resources you use

203
00:06:38,133 --> 00:06:39,834
in serving that request,

204
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:42,067
and even then,
you only pay for the resources

205
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:43,701
beyond our free quotas.

206
00:06:43,701 --> 00:06:45,501
Now, anyone can log in

207
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:47,434
and try out
our billing support today.

208
00:06:47,434 --> 00:06:48,567
It's open to everyone.

209
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:50,167
Here, I have
a quick screenshot

210
00:06:50,167 --> 00:06:51,400
so you can see how it works

211
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,400
if you don't have a big app
on App Engine.

212
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,400
As you can see here,

213
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,000
this app's got billing enabled,

214
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,467
and we've got different bars

215
00:06:57,467 --> 00:06:59,434
that show how much we're using
of each resource,

216
00:06:59,434 --> 00:07:01,767
like CPU and bandwidth
and so on.

217
00:07:01,767 --> 00:07:03,701
You can see on the side

218
00:07:03,701 --> 00:07:04,834
that we have our budget

219
00:07:04,834 --> 00:07:06,834
and how much
the resource costs per unit.

220
00:07:06,834 --> 00:07:09,400
And on the graph
you can see there's a line.

221
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,968
That's our free quota.

222
00:07:10,968 --> 00:07:12,667
When you go beyond
the free quota,

223
00:07:12,667 --> 00:07:14,601
you just pay
according to the cost

224
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:15,734
you see on the side

225
00:07:15,734 --> 00:07:17,601
within the budget
you've specified.

226
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:19,734
That's it.

227
00:07:19,734 --> 00:07:21,200
Now, something else
that we've heard

228
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,334
from a lot of you guys

229
00:07:22,334 --> 00:07:23,801
is that you'd really like a way

230
00:07:23,801 --> 00:07:26,601
to do some work outside
of the user's request,

231
00:07:26,601 --> 00:07:27,901
outside of the web request

232
00:07:27,901 --> 00:07:29,801
that came in
to your application.

233
00:07:29,801 --> 00:07:31,267
Now, we're working on

234
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:33,634
a much larger-scale,
offline system

235
00:07:33,634 --> 00:07:36,267
to handle processing
lots and lots of data.

236
00:07:36,267 --> 00:07:38,167
We're not done with that yet,

237
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:40,601
but tonight we want to take
a first step

238
00:07:40,601 --> 00:07:43,000
in the right direction
for offline processing,

239
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,634
so we're happy
to announce to you

240
00:07:44,634 --> 00:07:46,167
our cron support for App Engine.

241
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:49,534
[light applause]

242
00:07:49,534 --> 00:07:50,534
Smaller audience.

243
00:07:50,534 --> 00:07:52,667
Our cron support for App Engine

244
00:07:52,667 --> 00:07:55,534
makes it easy for you to list
some URLs in your application,

245
00:07:55,534 --> 00:07:57,400
and then have those URLs hit

246
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,601
according to a schedule
that you specify.

247
00:07:59,601 --> 00:08:01,300
When those URLs are hit,

248
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,100
we just send a request
to your application,

249
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,100
and you can do anything
that you'd like.

250
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,634
Now, it's very flexible.

251
00:08:06,634 --> 00:08:09,767
You can ask that URLs are hit
once per minute or hour,

252
00:08:09,767 --> 00:08:12,534
or as specific
as every second Tuesday.

253
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:14,901
That makes it easy for you

254
00:08:14,901 --> 00:08:17,534
to execute regularly scheduled
tasks in your application,

255
00:08:17,534 --> 00:08:20,400
like sending a weekly mailing
or clearing out a summary

256
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,934
or stuff like that.

257
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:24,300
So I have a quick example
of the configuration,

258
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,601
so you can see how easy it is

259
00:08:25,601 --> 00:08:27,067
to use cron in an application.

260
00:08:27,067 --> 00:08:28,968
This is a cron.yaml file,

261
00:08:28,968 --> 00:08:31,934
and here you can see
I specified two cron jobs.

262
00:08:31,934 --> 00:08:33,100
One of them says

263
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,734
that I would like to have
a daily summary.

264
00:08:34,734 --> 00:08:36,734
That's going to hit the
tasks/summary URL,

265
00:08:36,734 --> 00:08:38,400
and I said that
I want to hit it every day,

266
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,934
every 24 hours.

267
00:08:39,934 --> 00:08:41,634
You can see
I have another URL.

268
00:08:41,634 --> 00:08:44,000
This is the weekly mailout
under mail/weekly,

269
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,234
and this will be hit
every Monday at 9:00 a.m.

270
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,100
on Australian time.

271
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,868
So I've also got another
example for you here

272
00:08:51,868 --> 00:08:53,601
which is an application

273
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:55,234
running on our cluster
right now,

274
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:56,501
a cron prober application,

275
00:08:56,501 --> 00:08:58,434
and you can see
it's actively being hit

276
00:08:58,434 --> 00:09:00,567
by App Engine
in response to your request.

277
00:09:00,567 --> 00:09:04,067
You can see we got a minutely
and an hourly probe in there.
