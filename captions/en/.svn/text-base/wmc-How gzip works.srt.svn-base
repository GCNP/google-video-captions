00:00:06,234 --> 00:00:07,501
Higgins: Hi, my name's Eric.

2
00:00:07,501 --> 00:00:08,701
Khaw: My name is Kevin.

3
00:00:08,701 --> 00:00:10,501
Higgins: And we're webmasters
at Google.

4
00:00:10,501 --> 00:00:13,100
Khaw: Today we're gonna talk
about making websites faster

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,167
using GNU zip compression,
better known as gzip.

6
00:00:16,167 --> 00:00:19,067
Higgins: The idea behind using
gzip compression

7
00:00:19,067 --> 00:00:21,968
is to reduce the traffic
between your web server

8
00:00:21,968 --> 00:00:23,834
and your browsers.

9
00:00:23,834 --> 00:00:25,968
By using gzip compression,
you can reduce

10
00:00:25,968 --> 00:00:28,133
the file size of your pages
and your style sheets

11
00:00:28,133 --> 00:00:29,868
up to 70%.

12
00:00:29,868 --> 00:00:32,167
Khaw: Gzip is supported
on a majority of browsers,

13
00:00:32,167 --> 00:00:33,934
including mobile web browsers.

14
00:00:33,934 --> 00:00:38,000
Enabling gzip on your server
is as easy as flipping a switch.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,534
Higgins: Let's take a look
at how this works.

16
00:00:40,534 --> 00:00:43,167
I'm a browser.
Khaw: I'm a web server.

17
00:00:43,167 --> 00:00:46,133
Higgins: Hey, web server.
Send me your web page.

18
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:47,300
And do you support gzip?

19
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,334
Khaw: No, I don't really support
gzip.

20
00:00:49,334 --> 00:00:50,334
Here's your web page.

21
00:00:50,334 --> 00:00:51,801
Higgins: [groans]

22
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:54,501
Khaw: Hmm, maybe I need
to support gzip.

23
00:00:54,501 --> 00:00:56,100
Higgins: I'm still a browser.

24
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,634
Khaw: I'm still a web server.

25
00:00:57,634 --> 00:00:59,334
Higgins: Hey, web server,
can you send me your website?

26
00:00:59,334 --> 00:01:00,334
And do you support gzip?

27
00:01:00,334 --> 00:01:01,868
Khaw: Yes, I do support gzip.

28
00:01:01,868 --> 00:01:03,133
Here's the web page.

29
00:01:03,133 --> 00:01:05,968
Higgins: That was fast.
Hey, nice website.

30
00:01:05,968 --> 00:01:07,901
Now I would like to show you
how gzip works

31
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,901
at a lower level
so that you can try

32
00:01:09,901 --> 00:01:11,567
and use this information
to your advantage

33
00:01:11,567 --> 00:01:13,834
when coding your page.

34
00:01:13,834 --> 00:01:16,300
Gzip's compression algorithm
finds similar strings

35
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,901
within a file,
then compresses them out.

36
00:01:18,901 --> 00:01:21,200
So the more matching strings
you have in a file,

37
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,434
the smaller
your files can compress.

38
00:01:23,434 --> 00:01:26,868
This is ideal for HTML,
which is typically full

39
00:01:26,868 --> 00:01:29,467
of white space
and matching tags.

40
00:01:29,467 --> 00:01:32,601
Now let's see gzip
in action.

41
00:01:32,601 --> 00:01:35,067
Here I have
two simple HTML pages.

42
00:01:35,067 --> 00:01:38,300
In each file, I have a list
of ten items.

43
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,400
In the first file,
I have a list

44
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,734
of different names,
and in the second file,

45
00:01:42,734 --> 00:01:45,667
I repeated the word Google
ten times.

46
00:01:45,667 --> 00:01:47,834
Now let's take a look
at the file sizes.

47
00:01:47,834 --> 00:01:51,000
Uncompressed, the files
are roughly the same size.

48
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,133
But notice that google.html
is five bytes larger

49
00:01:54,133 --> 00:01:56,000
than names.html.

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,133
Now let's compress these files
with gzip

51
00:01:58,133 --> 00:02:01,801
and see what
the resulting file sizes are.

52
00:02:01,801 --> 00:02:04,701
You can see that the files
are about 40% smaller,

53
00:02:04,701 --> 00:02:08,033
and google.html compressed
to be about 50 bytes smaller

54
00:02:08,033 --> 00:02:10,367
than names.html.

55
00:02:10,367 --> 00:02:13,801
I hope this helps you to speed
up your web pages using gzip.

00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:16,901
