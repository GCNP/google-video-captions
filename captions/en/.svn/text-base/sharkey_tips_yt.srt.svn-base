1
00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:01,434
Sharkey: So one of the things
I've learned

2
00:00:01,434 --> 00:00:02,868
as I've been jumping
into Android

3
00:00:02,868 --> 00:00:04,267
is about
all of the features

4
00:00:04,267 --> 00:00:05,767
that you can
really take advantage of,

5
00:00:05,767 --> 00:00:07,634
and one of those
is stateful drawables.

6
00:00:07,634 --> 00:00:10,033
Now, I've come from
a Swing background in Java,

7
00:00:10,033 --> 00:00:11,434
and so I'm used to, okay,

8
00:00:11,434 --> 00:00:12,634
let's say I have
a button on the screen,

9
00:00:12,634 --> 00:00:13,968
and when the user clicks
on that button,

10
00:00:13,968 --> 00:00:15,234
or maybe they mouse over it,

11
00:00:15,234 --> 00:00:16,667
I want that icon to change,

12
00:00:16,667 --> 00:00:18,667
uh, to maybe
an inverted icon.

13
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:20,701
Uh, so the way
I'd write that in Swing

14
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:22,234
is you'd write
an onClick listener

15
00:00:22,234 --> 00:00:24,467
or an onMouseOver--
a mouse move listener

16
00:00:24,467 --> 00:00:26,801
to watch for those actions
and then swap out the image.

17
00:00:26,801 --> 00:00:29,200
Um, but with Android,
you don't have to write those.

18
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,701
With stateful drawables,
you can have a single image

19
00:00:31,701 --> 00:00:33,200
that changes the image it--

20
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,567
that changes what it is
based on the state.

21
00:00:35,567 --> 00:00:37,634
So I don't have
to write that code.

22
00:00:37,634 --> 00:00:39,334
As the user
moves over something,

23
00:00:39,334 --> 00:00:41,501
or when they touch something,
or as they check an item,

24
00:00:41,501 --> 00:00:44,033
that i--that image
automatically changes for me.

25
00:00:44,033 --> 00:00:46,334
A second thing
I've really found valuable

26
00:00:46,334 --> 00:00:47,634
is the Hierarchy Viewer.

27
00:00:47,634 --> 00:00:48,901
I've found myself
a lot of times

28
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:50,167
as I'm trying
to lay out a view

29
00:00:50,167 --> 00:00:52,300
and really see how things work
on the screen,

30
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,834
that it doesn't look
the way I want it to.

31
00:00:53,834 --> 00:00:55,100
Something's not working out.

32
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,367
And so many times,

33
00:00:56,367 --> 00:00:57,934
instead of just
tweaking little changes

34
00:00:57,934 --> 00:00:59,300
one at a time
to see, you know,

35
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,667
"How can I fix this?

36
00:01:00,667 --> 00:01:02,567
How can I make this layout
work the way I want it to?"

37
00:01:02,567 --> 00:01:03,834
I can use
the Hierarchy Viewer

38
00:01:03,834 --> 00:01:05,334
to really drill down and see

39
00:01:05,334 --> 00:01:07,100
how things are being
laid out on the device,

40
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,234
where the boundaries
of the objects are,

41
00:01:09,234 --> 00:01:10,734
so that I can clearly see

42
00:01:10,734 --> 00:01:12,000
where things
are being laid out

43
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,767
and how I could reorganize
to solve the problem

44
00:01:13,767 --> 00:01:15,901
and fix the view to make it
the way I want it.
