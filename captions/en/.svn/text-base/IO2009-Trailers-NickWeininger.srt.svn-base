>> Weininger:
Hi, I'm Nick Weininger,

2
00:00:06,234 --> 00:00:08,901
and I'm an engineer
on Google Custom Search Engine.

3
00:00:08,901 --> 00:00:10,467
And at Google I/O,

4
00:00:10,467 --> 00:00:11,667
I'm going to be giving a talk

5
00:00:11,667 --> 00:00:14,200
on advanced
custom search configuration.

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,834
You may have already heard
about a custom search engine

7
00:00:16,834 --> 00:00:18,934
as a tool for allowing you,

8
00:00:18,934 --> 00:00:21,467
very easily
through a web interface,

9
00:00:21,467 --> 00:00:22,767
to create a search engine

10
00:00:22,767 --> 00:00:24,634
that is built on Google
search results,

11
00:00:24,634 --> 00:00:27,634
but searches over a slice
of the web you're interested in,

12
00:00:27,634 --> 00:00:29,067
which can be one site

13
00:00:29,067 --> 00:00:30,834
or some parts of a site,

14
00:00:30,834 --> 00:00:32,734
or a thousand
different sites.

15
00:00:32,734 --> 00:00:34,200
But what you may not know

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,367
is that Custom Search

17
00:00:35,367 --> 00:00:37,901
is also a very powerful
developer platform,

18
00:00:37,901 --> 00:00:40,100
and that's
what I'm going to talk about.

19
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,000
The reason that it is
a developer platform

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,501
is that we provide an XML API

21
00:00:45,501 --> 00:00:48,267
both for the definition
of our custom search engine

22
00:00:48,267 --> 00:00:50,601
and for the results
that you get back

23
00:00:50,601 --> 00:00:52,534
when you query
a custom search engine.

24
00:00:52,534 --> 00:00:55,234
And using that XML API,

25
00:00:55,234 --> 00:00:56,934
you can programmatically create

26
00:00:56,934 --> 00:00:59,167
large numbers
of custom search engines.

27
00:00:59,167 --> 00:01:04,133
You can use the API to provide
advanced ranking tweaks

28
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:06,767
so that the ranking of your
search results is different

29
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:09,534
from that of regular
Google search results,

30
00:01:09,534 --> 00:01:10,934
and you can customize

31
00:01:10,934 --> 00:01:12,734
the presentation
of your results,

32
00:01:12,734 --> 00:01:14,033
so that they look
very different

33
00:01:14,033 --> 00:01:15,334
from Google search results

34
00:01:15,334 --> 00:01:16,334
and can be mashed up

35
00:01:16,334 --> 00:01:18,567
with other content
that you have.

36
00:01:18,567 --> 00:01:22,200
To give you briefly an example
of how that XML API works,

37
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,501
let me show you

38
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:27,033
what a custom search engine
definition looks like.

39
00:01:27,033 --> 00:01:29,934
This is, in some sense,
the top level part.

40
00:01:29,934 --> 00:01:32,367
It gives you the title
of the custom search engine.

41
00:01:32,367 --> 00:01:33,834
It gives you some labels

42
00:01:33,834 --> 00:01:35,868
which pertain to the refinements

43
00:01:35,868 --> 00:01:38,200
that you can have
to navigate in that engine,

44
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,834
including one as you see
which is "BOOST" labeled,

45
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:42,334
which tweaks the ranking.

46
00:01:42,334 --> 00:01:45,567
And then it points
to these other labels

47
00:01:45,567 --> 00:01:48,934
which we'll use in another part
of the XML definition

48
00:01:48,934 --> 00:01:50,968
to define the set of sites

49
00:01:50,968 --> 00:01:53,033
that's included
in the custom search engine.

50
00:01:53,033 --> 00:01:54,934
So if you want to hear more,

51
00:01:54,934 --> 00:01:56,234
if you want to know more

52
00:01:56,234 --> 00:01:58,868
about how to configure
custom search engines

53
00:01:58,868 --> 00:01:59,868
for your users,

54
00:01:59,868 --> 00:02:01,601
please come
to my Google I/O talk--

55
00:02:01,601 --> 00:02:03,200

Configuration.

56
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,133
Thank you.
