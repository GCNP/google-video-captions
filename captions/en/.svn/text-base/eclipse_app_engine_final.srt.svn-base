00:00:05,167 --> 00:00:06,467
Marks: Hi.
I'm Mano Marks.

2
00:00:06,467 --> 00:00:08,667
And I work
with Google App Engine.

3
00:00:08,667 --> 00:00:10,033
If you've gotten this far,

4
00:00:10,033 --> 00:00:12,534
you're probably aware
that App Engine enables you

5
00:00:12,534 --> 00:00:14,634
to build scalable
web applications

6
00:00:14,634 --> 00:00:18,634
on the same systems
that power Google applications.

7
00:00:18,634 --> 00:00:21,100
This video walks you through
setting up Eclipse,

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,901
an integrated development
environment.

9
00:00:22,901 --> 00:00:25,601
It's based on an excellent
article by Joscha Feth

10
00:00:25,601 --> 00:00:27,300
on code.google.com.

11
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:37,167
Download and install
Python 2.5 or higher.

12
00:00:37,167 --> 00:00:40,701
Download and install the latest
version of Eclipse.

13
00:00:40,701 --> 00:00:44,501
For this demo, we will be using
Eclipse 3.4.0.

14
00:00:44,501 --> 00:00:46,801
Download and install
the latest version

15
00:00:46,801 --> 00:00:49,934
of the App Engine development
server.

16
00:00:49,934 --> 00:00:52,734
All right.
So to start configuring Eclipse.

17
00:00:52,734 --> 00:00:56,734
Eclipse is a flexible
development environment.

18
00:00:56,734 --> 00:00:58,234
With the proper plug-ins,

19
00:00:58,234 --> 00:01:01,667
it can be used with many
different programming languages.

20
00:01:01,667 --> 00:01:04,067
In order to set it up
to work with Python,

21
00:01:04,067 --> 00:01:07,200
you need to set up
a Python plug-in.

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,033
We're going to use Pydev.

23
00:01:09,033 --> 00:01:11,334
So in order
to install Pydev,

24
00:01:11,334 --> 00:01:15,100
open Eclipse and go to Help,
Software Updates.

25
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,701
Click Add Site.

26
00:01:19,801 --> 00:01:23,300
And then enter
pydev.sourceforge.net/updates

27
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,400
in the location field.

28
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,834
And click OK.

29
00:01:30,567 --> 00:01:33,734
Next, select the Pydev updates
that you just added.

30
00:01:33,734 --> 00:01:37,767
Choose to install
Pydev for Eclipse.

31
00:01:37,767 --> 00:01:40,868
After the update site
has been searched,

32
00:01:40,868 --> 00:01:42,968
click on Finish.

33
00:01:46,033 --> 00:01:48,133
Choose Yes to restart
Eclipse.

34
00:01:50,234 --> 00:01:52,567
After Eclipse restarts,

35
00:01:52,567 --> 00:01:54,767
choose Windows,
Preferences

36
00:01:54,767 --> 00:01:56,567
to bring up the Preferences
dialogue.

37
00:01:56,567 --> 00:02:00,300
Change the Pydev Interpreter
Python section

38
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,701
to configure Python.

39
00:02:04,634 --> 00:02:06,601
Click on New.

40
00:02:06,601 --> 00:02:09,634
Search for the python.exe
executable,

41
00:02:09,634 --> 00:02:13,734
normally at C:\Python25.

42
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:15,567
After you select
the executable,

43
00:02:15,567 --> 00:02:17,667
Pydev will search
for libraries

44
00:02:17,667 --> 00:02:19,834
and the following screen
appears.

45
00:02:19,834 --> 00:02:23,267
Normally the preselection
done by Pydev is fine.

46
00:02:23,267 --> 00:02:27,734
So click on OK to accept
the system Python path entries.

47
00:02:27,734 --> 00:02:28,901
In the Preferences window,

48
00:02:28,901 --> 00:02:31,234
click OK to configure
your changes.

49
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:34,067
After you have Pydev
installed on Eclipse,

50
00:02:34,067 --> 00:02:37,901
you are ready to start
developing your application.

51
00:02:37,901 --> 00:02:39,567
Right click
on the package explorer

52
00:02:39,567 --> 00:02:41,801
and choose New, Other.

53
00:02:41,801 --> 00:02:43,634
In the dialogue box,

54
00:02:43,634 --> 00:02:47,734
select Pydev Project
from the Pydev folder.

55
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:53,501
Create a new helloworld project
with Python 2.5.

56
00:02:53,501 --> 00:02:55,300
After clicking Finish,

57
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,167
Eclipse will switch
to the Pydev view.

58
00:02:58,167 --> 00:03:02,601
Right click on your new project
and choose Properties.

59
00:03:02,601 --> 00:03:04,067
In the properties dialogue,

60
00:03:04,067 --> 00:03:06,467
choose the Pydev
PYTHONPATH section

61
00:03:06,467 --> 00:03:09,334
to add the App Engine
libraries.

62
00:03:09,334 --> 00:03:11,534
Click on Add source folder

63
00:03:11,534 --> 00:03:13,634
to add the following folders

64
00:03:13,634 --> 00:03:16,801
from your Google App Engine
folder.

65
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:22,634
Click OK to confirm
your changes.

66
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,434
The last thing we need to do
is create an application

67
00:03:27,434 --> 00:03:30,767
and add
a run configuration.

68
00:03:30,767 --> 00:03:32,968
We're going to use
the helloworld code

69
00:03:32,968 --> 00:03:36,968
from the Getting Started section
of the documentation.

70
00:03:39,133 --> 00:03:42,300
Here you see me creating
the app.yaml

71
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,734
and helloworld.py files.

72
00:03:49,934 --> 00:03:52,434
Go to Run,
Run Configurations.

73
00:03:52,434 --> 00:03:57,033
Choose Python Run and add a new
launch configuration.

74
00:03:59,868 --> 00:04:01,801
Name your run configuration.

75
00:04:01,801 --> 00:04:03,133
Under Project,

76
00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:06,501
add your Google App Engine
Python project.

77
00:04:06,501 --> 00:04:08,000
Under Main Module,

78
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,934
add the location
of the dev_appserver.py script.

79
00:04:16,434 --> 00:04:18,200
Change to the Arguments tab

80
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,133
and enter this code
as your first argument.

81
00:04:24,734 --> 00:04:25,968
After this argument,

82
00:04:25,968 --> 00:04:28,534
you may add all available
additional arguments

83
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:32,834
listed on the dev web server
documentation page.

84
00:04:32,834 --> 00:04:34,934
Here, for example,
we change the port

85
00:04:34,934 --> 00:04:39,067
where Google App Engine
is listening to 9999.

86
00:04:39,067 --> 00:04:41,100
Click on Apply to save
your changes.

87
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,367
Click on Run to run
your application.

88
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:46,834
From now on, you can run
your project by selecting

89
00:04:46,834 --> 00:04:50,100
your configuration
from the Run dropdown

90
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:56,667
and access your app
on http://localhost:9999/

91
00:04:56,667 --> 00:05:01,667
