1
00:00:00,901 --> 00:00:01,534
Gundrota:
about HTML 5 standards,

2
00:00:01,534 --> 00:00:02,801
about evolution.

3
00:00:02,801 --> 00:00:04,067
But in reality,

4
00:00:04,067 --> 00:00:06,067
I'm not sure
we would've had this luxury

5
00:00:06,067 --> 00:00:08,601
had it not been for Mozilla's
and the community's

6
00:00:08,601 --> 00:00:11,100
phenomenal work
over ten years.

7
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,534
There was a time
when people wondered,

8
00:00:13,534 --> 00:00:16,434
uh, if the--that the odds
were against you guys

9
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:18,400
with, uh, competitors
that had the benefit

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,000
of preinstallation.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,133
But you guys really proved--
you proved--

12
00:00:23,133 --> 00:00:26,133
that you could build a community
of hundreds of millions

13
00:00:26,133 --> 00:00:28,467
of loyal consumers
who chose Firefox

14
00:00:28,467 --> 00:00:30,467
and you could build
a better web.

15
00:00:30,467 --> 00:00:32,634
So for all that you did,
for what you're doing now,

16
00:00:32,634 --> 00:00:34,767
and for what you will do,
thank you.

17
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:36,033
Sullivan: Thanks.
Thanks, Vic.

18
00:00:36,033 --> 00:00:38,434
Gundrota: Thank you.

19
00:00:43,767 --> 00:00:45,000
Sullivan: Well,
I want to thank Vic

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,067
for that introduction.

21
00:00:46,067 --> 00:00:47,968
Um, not for myself,

22
00:00:47,968 --> 00:00:49,968
but on behalf of the whole
Mozilla community

23
00:00:49,968 --> 00:00:52,067
around the world
that's made that possible.

24
00:00:52,067 --> 00:00:55,567
Um, it's an amazing,
vibrant, crazy organization

25
00:00:55,567 --> 00:00:57,567
that it's fun
to be a part of.

26
00:00:57,567 --> 00:01:00,434
Um, I want to do three things
today, um, real briefly.

27
00:01:00,434 --> 00:01:03,434
I want to explain
why Mozilla's here at I/O.

28
00:01:03,434 --> 00:01:04,767
I want to talk
about what's coming

29
00:01:04,767 --> 00:01:06,667
in Firefox for developers,

30
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:07,968
and I want to give you
a brief demo

31
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:11,567
of geolocation support
in the browser.

32
00:01:11,567 --> 00:01:13,734
So...

33
00:01:13,734 --> 00:01:15,634
browser competition
is heating up again.

34
00:01:15,634 --> 00:01:17,701
That's--that's no secret
to anybody here.

35
00:01:17,701 --> 00:01:19,434
Um, and we think
this is very important.

36
00:01:19,434 --> 00:01:23,534
As users live more and more
of their lives online,

37
00:01:23,534 --> 00:01:25,234
it's very important
that we continue

38
00:01:25,234 --> 00:01:29,434
to improve the user experience,
to make the browser faster,

39
00:01:29,434 --> 00:01:32,934
and to protect user security
and privacy online.

40
00:01:32,934 --> 00:01:34,968
And we see what happens

41
00:01:34,968 --> 00:01:37,734
when there isn't any competition
in the marketplace.

42
00:01:37,734 --> 00:01:39,968
Things stagnate.
There aren't new features.

43
00:01:39,968 --> 00:01:41,634
The web does not get better.

44
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:44,133
Now, since we entered the market
with Firefox

45
00:01:44,133 --> 00:01:46,133
and other browsers
have followed--

46
00:01:46,133 --> 00:01:48,701
these modern browsers
that we're talking about today--

47
00:01:48,701 --> 00:01:50,367
that's improved
the user experience.

48
00:01:50,367 --> 00:01:52,734
So it's very important
to have that vibrant competition

49
00:01:52,734 --> 00:01:53,868
in the marketplace.

50
00:01:53,868 --> 00:01:55,300
And we're glad
that these other--

51
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,701
other folks
are producing browsers.

52
00:01:57,701 --> 00:02:00,934
Now, it's also important to note
that each of our organizations

53
00:02:00,934 --> 00:02:04,334
have very different missions
and motivations

54
00:02:04,334 --> 00:02:06,467
for why we work
on web browsers.

55
00:02:06,467 --> 00:02:08,634
But today,
we put all that aside

56
00:02:08,634 --> 00:02:11,234
to focus on what we share
in common.

57
00:02:11,234 --> 00:02:12,834
So we share, I think,

58
00:02:12,834 --> 00:02:15,167
three important things
in common.

59
00:02:15,167 --> 00:02:18,067
One, we believe strongly

60
00:02:18,067 --> 00:02:20,767
that the web
is the development platform

61
00:02:20,767 --> 00:02:22,534
for our time.

62
00:02:22,534 --> 00:02:24,367
More than any single
operating system,

63
00:02:24,367 --> 00:02:26,367
the web is going to drive
the innovation

64
00:02:26,367 --> 00:02:29,200
and the new services that are
going to do amazing things

65
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,434
for people all around
the world.

66
00:02:31,434 --> 00:02:34,968
We also share a belief
that we need to keep bringing

67
00:02:34,968 --> 00:02:37,234
new capabilities
to you as developers

68
00:02:37,234 --> 00:02:38,734
so you can create
these things.

69
00:02:38,734 --> 00:02:41,334
And that means
that we need to move quickly.

70
00:02:41,334 --> 00:02:44,834
But also we need to make sure
that we don't fragment the web.

71
00:02:44,834 --> 00:02:46,267
There will be
no worse outcome

72
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:47,968
than through
this renewed competition

73
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:50,901
to have a fragmentation
of the web platform.

74
00:02:50,901 --> 00:02:52,868
You should be able to focus
on--on building your house

75
00:02:52,868 --> 00:02:53,868
and not worrying

76
00:02:53,868 --> 00:02:55,367
about the cross-browser
plumbing.

77
00:02:55,367 --> 00:02:56,801
So we need
to work together

78
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:59,801
to--to keep that standards
held together.

79
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:01,534
And that's a challenge.
And it's--it's the web.

80
00:03:01,534 --> 00:03:02,834
So it's messy, right?

81
00:03:02,834 --> 00:03:05,601
So we don't always agree
on what the perfect API is

82
00:03:05,601 --> 00:03:07,834
to expose a new piece
of functionality.

83
00:03:07,834 --> 00:03:09,667
We don't even always agree
on the process

84
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:11,400
to run some experiments
and then decide

85
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,334
which the best API
should be.

86
00:03:13,334 --> 00:03:16,534
But I strongly believe
that a-a very, very good API

87
00:03:16,534 --> 00:03:18,634
for something
that's in five browsers

88
00:03:18,634 --> 00:03:21,467
is better than a perfect API
that's in no browsers

89
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:22,801
or one browser.

90
00:03:22,801 --> 00:03:24,968
So we need to work hard
together with Google

91
00:03:24,968 --> 00:03:27,367
and the other browser vendors
to hold that center.

92
00:03:27,367 --> 00:03:29,734
And that's very important.

93
00:03:29,734 --> 00:03:31,534
I want to talk a little bit
about what's coming

94
00:03:31,534 --> 00:03:34,400
in Firefox 3.5
for developers.

95
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,234
Now Firefox 3.0
is the most successful browser

96
00:03:38,234 --> 00:03:39,767
that we've ever built.

97
00:03:39,767 --> 00:03:42,901
Um, we have about 300 million
users worldwide.

98
00:03:42,901 --> 00:03:45,467
We just recently had
our one billionth

99
00:03:45,467 --> 00:03:46,868
add-on download.

100
00:03:46,868 --> 00:03:49,968
Um, so Firefox 3 has been
phenomenally successful.

101
00:03:49,968 --> 00:03:52,934
But--but we believe
Firefox 3.5 is better.

102
00:03:52,934 --> 00:03:54,367
We believe it's much better.

103
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:55,901
Uh, JavaScript performance,

104
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:57,434
which is
the underlying piece

105
00:03:57,434 --> 00:03:59,501
that dr--that--that enables
all of this innovation

106
00:03:59,501 --> 00:04:00,667
in these apps that we're--

107
00:04:00,667 --> 00:04:02,200
that we're working hard
to build--

108
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,767
JavaScript performance
is three times faster

109
00:04:04,767 --> 00:04:07,667
in 3.5
than it was in 3.0.

110
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:10,400
And ten times faster
than it was in 2.0.

111
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,267
So we've been working very hard
to increase the speed

112
00:04:12,267 --> 00:04:14,534
of JavaScript execution.

113
00:04:14,534 --> 00:04:17,767
Um, you heard a little bit
about how canvas works

114
00:04:17,767 --> 00:04:19,334
and how video works.

115
00:04:19,334 --> 00:04:21,133
And what I think
is important here

116
00:04:21,133 --> 00:04:22,734
is getting things
like video

117
00:04:22,734 --> 00:04:24,734
out of, uh,
out of plug-in prison

118
00:04:24,734 --> 00:04:26,200
so that we can script them.

119
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,901
And when you combine things
like video and canvas

120
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:30,267
as--as Vic demo'ed,

121
00:04:30,267 --> 00:04:32,767
you start to see the power
of being able to use things

122
00:04:32,767 --> 00:04:34,901
through--through web APIs

123
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:36,234
and be able
to manipulate them

124
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,501
and mash them up
in new ways.

125
00:04:37,501 --> 00:04:38,667
And that's really
a common theme

126
00:04:38,667 --> 00:04:40,033
for some of this
new functionality

127
00:04:40,033 --> 00:04:41,234
is it's the web.

128
00:04:41,234 --> 00:04:42,567
You should be able
to touch anything,

129
00:04:42,567 --> 00:04:44,834
hack anything,
and mash up anything.

130
00:04:44,834 --> 00:04:47,868
Um, we're adding support
for geolocation.

131
00:04:47,868 --> 00:04:50,300
And I'll talk about that more
in a minute.

132
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,000
We're also--we also have support
for offline storage

133
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,567
so that you can begin
to write apps that work better

134
00:04:55,567 --> 00:04:57,300
when they're disconnected.

135
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,734
That's--that's very important
for mobile situations

136
00:04:59,734 --> 00:05:01,267
and--and other use cases.

137
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:03,834
And we're also adding support
for Web Workers

138
00:05:03,834 --> 00:05:06,501
so that you can write scripts
that run pretty intensively

139
00:05:06,501 --> 00:05:09,200
without hosing your browser,
a very important feature.

140
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,334
And all this stuff is--
is, um, you can--

141
00:05:12,334 --> 00:05:13,934
you can look at the link
up there and go there

142
00:05:13,934 --> 00:05:15,234
and it'll take you
to a description

143
00:05:15,234 --> 00:05:16,968
of how to use
these new APIs

144
00:05:16,968 --> 00:05:21,501
and exactly what the level
of support is in Firefox 3.5.

145
00:05:21,501 --> 00:05:23,033
Um, I want to talk
a little bit now

146
00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:25,567
about geolocation support
in the browser.

147
00:05:25,567 --> 00:05:27,234
So in Firefox 3.5,

148
00:05:27,234 --> 00:05:30,767
there's support
for, um, the geolocation API.

149
00:05:30,767 --> 00:05:33,000
And I'm going to give you a demo
of one of the apps,

150
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,534
um, that's going
to use this.

151
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:41,200
So be believe
that there are use cases

152
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,567
in--in many, many,
um, spheres

153
00:05:43,567 --> 00:05:45,634
for geolocation support.

154
00:05:45,634 --> 00:05:49,400
Um, we--we think it's going
to change how maps,

155
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,634
local search, directions,
all sorts of social networking--

156
00:05:52,634 --> 00:05:54,100
anywhere where you want
to tag something

157
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,334
with your location,

158
00:05:55,334 --> 00:05:56,834
we believe it's going
to change the nature

159
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:59,067
of how all
of those applications work.

160
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,767
One particular application
that's going to take advantage

161
00:06:01,767 --> 00:06:07,234
of Firefox's support
for geolocation is Google Maps.

162
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:10,334
So Google Maps, shortly,
will be adding a new button

163
00:06:10,334 --> 00:06:13,400
to the user interface
called "my location."

164
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,067
And if I click this button,
I get a prompt.

165
00:06:16,067 --> 00:06:18,300
And I get request for--
if I would like to share

166
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,267
my location
with that web site.

167
00:06:20,267 --> 00:06:21,667
I'm going to go ahead
and click share--

168
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:22,901
I'm going to come back
to this

169
00:06:22,901 --> 00:06:24,534
'cause I want to talk
about this a little bit.

170
00:06:24,534 --> 00:06:26,200
But I'm going to go ahead
and share my location.

171
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,868
Couldn't be determined.
Let's try that again.

172
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:42,767
Okay.

173
00:06:42,767 --> 00:06:47,868
[applause]

174
00:06:47,868 --> 00:06:49,300
Murphy's Law of demos.

175
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,300
Um, so--so I wanted to explain
what's happened there.

176
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,033
So, um, what happened
when I clicked that button

177
00:06:55,033 --> 00:06:57,534
was the browser gathered up
the signal strengths

178
00:06:57,534 --> 00:06:59,501
of all the nearby
Wi-Fi hotspots

179
00:06:59,501 --> 00:07:02,534
and transformed that
into a latitude and longitude.

180
00:07:02,534 --> 00:07:03,868
If it was a cell phone,

181
00:07:03,868 --> 00:07:05,000
I could've used Wi-Fi

182
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,334
or I could've used
cell tower IDs

183
00:07:07,334 --> 00:07:09,934
and the signal strength
of those that are nearby.

184
00:07:09,934 --> 00:07:13,434
Um, I could even use GPS
if it's local to--to the device.

185
00:07:13,434 --> 00:07:15,701
So there's a number of ways
a back-end provider,

186
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:17,534
uh, can enable
that functionality.

187
00:07:17,534 --> 00:07:20,067
And because it's Firefox,
user choice is important.

188
00:07:20,067 --> 00:07:21,834
So users will be able
to download

189
00:07:21,834 --> 00:07:23,734
all sorts of add-ons
that are going to provide

190
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:25,968
that back-end location
functionality.

191
00:07:25,968 --> 00:07:28,367
And web developers
can enable their applications

192
00:07:28,367 --> 00:07:30,968
with just a couple lines
of JavaScript code.

193
00:07:30,968 --> 00:07:33,100
It's dead simple to use
the API.

194
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,934
I want to come back to one thing
real briefly though,

195
00:07:34,934 --> 00:07:37,033
which is--which is how a user
opts in.

196
00:07:37,033 --> 00:07:39,200
I think this is very important
for features like this

197
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,467
that begin to blend services
with client-side functionality.

198
00:07:45,601 --> 00:07:48,200
Now, when I click the button,
I get this mode list info bar.

199
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,534
Now, don't try
to write down the URL.

200
00:07:49,534 --> 00:07:50,667
It's not going to work.

201
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:52,200
It's behind
some Google firewall.

202
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,000
Uh, don't try this
at home yet.

203
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Um, so--but I get a--
I get information

204
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,367
about what domain name
is requesting my location.

205
00:07:59,367 --> 00:08:01,467
I can click "learn more"
if I want to understand

206
00:08:01,467 --> 00:08:02,634
how the service works

207
00:08:02,634 --> 00:08:04,868
and how the privacy
policies work.

208
00:08:04,868 --> 00:08:07,167
And if I just ignore this,
nothing happens.

209
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,234
If I close it,
nothing happens.

210
00:08:09,234 --> 00:08:10,567
If I hit don't share--

211
00:08:10,567 --> 00:08:12,400
and I can remember
that not sharing

212
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,267
so that I don't get prompted
in the future--

213
00:08:14,267 --> 00:08:15,300
any of those things

214
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,968
and my location
is never accessed

215
00:08:16,968 --> 00:08:18,300
by the browser.

216
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,100
It's only if I explicitly
opt in.

217
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,734
And that has to happen
on a per hostname basis

218
00:08:22,734 --> 00:08:23,834
for this to work.

219
00:08:23,834 --> 00:08:25,067
So we're trying to err
on the side

220
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:26,901
of--of the user
being in control.

221
00:08:26,901 --> 00:08:29,601
Even though it might include
an extra click here and there,

222
00:08:29,601 --> 00:08:32,334
we think it's important
to err on that side.

223
00:08:32,334 --> 00:08:34,267
So, um, that's it
for the demo.

224
00:08:34,267 --> 00:08:36,200
We look forward to see
the--the great things

225
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,667
you're going to do
with geolocation

226
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:38,868
and with all
of these features.

227
00:08:38,868 --> 00:08:40,667
So thanks, Vic.

228
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:43,667
Gundrota: Thank you.
Thank you.

229
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:46,167
[applause]

230
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:48,534
Yeah, we love those guys
and can't wait to see

231
00:08:48,534 --> 00:08:50,100
what they're going
to do next.

232
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,501
Uh, geolocation
broadly available

233
00:08:52,501 --> 00:08:54,033
in modern browsers.

234
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,234
Uh, before we move on,

235
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:57,334
I should show you
one more geolocation demo.

236
00:08:57,334 --> 00:08:59,701
Uh, Jay mentioned the importance
of using geolocation

237
00:08:59,701 --> 00:09:01,367
in mobile scenarios.

238
00:09:01,367 --> 00:09:03,934
We've got exactly one
of those demos to show you.

239
00:09:03,934 --> 00:09:08,801
What you're looking at now
is Latitude.

240
00:09:08,801 --> 00:09:10,534
Latitude is an application
Google released

241
00:09:10,534 --> 00:09:12,868
several months ago
for phones like the BlackBerry,

242
00:09:12,868 --> 00:09:14,934
or Windows Mobile
or Nokia phones.

243
00:09:14,934 --> 00:09:16,434
What you're seeing
for the first time

244
00:09:16,434 --> 00:09:18,701
is Latitude on the iPhone.

245
00:09:18,701 --> 00:09:20,634
And there's even one more
surprise.

246
00:09:20,634 --> 00:09:24,567
It's Latitude on the iPhone
in the browser.

247
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:25,968
And the reason
this is possible

248
00:09:25,968 --> 00:09:27,267
is because
in the next generation

249
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:28,901
of Apple's
operating system,

250
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:33,434
they too have implemented
the W3C geolocation API.

251
00:09:33,434 --> 00:09:36,834
So we're able to build apps
that were formerly impossible,

252
00:09:36,834 --> 00:09:40,334
now possible right on the web,
uh, uh, on the platform.

253
00:09:40,334 --> 00:09:44,100
You--you'll see this app
shortly after Apple releases,

254
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,834
uh, OS 3.0.

255
00:09:45,834 --> 00:09:48,367
Okay, let's go back
to slides.

256
00:09:48,367 --> 00:09:50,100
And by the way,
that's another evidence

257
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,467
of Google making the bet
on HTML 5

258
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:55,734
and really try to build
those flagship apps

259
00:09:55,734 --> 00:09:57,801
so we can move
the web forward.

260
00:09:57,801 --> 00:10:00,133
Now let's move on and talk
about App Cache and Database.
