So, what we're going to
do now, is we're going to

*TC 00:00:07;04
write a simple application,
that gives gifts to our friends.

*TC 00:00:10;13
And the first thing that we're
going to need to do then,

*TC 00:00:12;02
if we're going to give gifts to
our friends, is we need to

*TC 00:00:14;02
know who our friends are.

*TC 00:00:15;14
So we're going to use the
Social API, to load our list

*TC 00:00:17;29
of friends, onto the page.

*TC 00:00:20;00
And we're going to begin,
by writing a

*TC 00:00:22;03
"registerOnLoadHandler"
function, that calls a

*TC 00:00:24;12
function "init", which calls a
function "loadFriends,"

*TC 00:00:28;05
to load our list of friends.

*TC 00:00:30;25
Within the "loadFriends"
function, we create a new

*TC 00:00:33;05
OpenSocial data request,
add into it requests for the

*TC 00:00:36;08
"viewer" and "viewerFriends"
information, and send the

*TC 00:00:39;16
request to the OpenSocial API.

*TC 00:00:41;26
Where it then calls
"onLoadFriends" once the

*TC 00:00:43;21
data has been returned.

*TC 00:00:45;17
The "onLoadFriends" function
does most of the work.

*TC 00:00:48;02
It pulls out information on the
"viewer" and the "viewerFriends"

*TC 00:00:50;22
from the data object, pushes that
list of friends into a list,

*TC 00:00:54;25
and then displays
the list onto the page.

*TC 00:00:57;00
Finally, we make some small
changes to the gadget XML file,

*TC 00:01:00;12
to allow us to insert the list of
friends into the page.

*TC 00:01:03;02
Now you can see our gadget
in action listing our friends.

did, and more information on the
